# M5.21.9 method note: the fixed-J isorotation electron + the Larmor acceptance run

**Status**: ✅ RUN + ROUND-2 ADDENDUM COMPLETE, AUDITED TWICE 2026-07-20 (round 1: 3 CONFIRMED / 6 NUANCE adopted / 0 refuted, § 10; round 2: 4/4 CONFIRMED, § 10b), the family of record re-based to the canonical conjugation tangent (§ 5). Headline: the fixed-J electron EXISTS and HOLDS on the certified stack (three J rungs + a t = 80 dynamics window) with its clock thermodynamics exact: dE/dJ = ω\* at 0.997 / 0.992 on the physical (conjugation) family, kin = 0.1206; the Larmor LINEAR read is closed as UNMEASURABLE in this instrument configuration (both discriminators run: the preparation-texture systematic dominates and the J-azimuth observable partially tracked a projected-out spectator; the ramp-on + body-frame redesign is documented, with a newly found nonzero static torque channel b = 5.98e-4 on the physical tangent); the first RESOLVED field response is a clean QUADRATIC (ε²) clock-drift slowdown; the author's δ < 0 family verifies at statics grade but does not survive free descent (boost channel, profile-independent). Task: [`../tasks/m5_21_9_task_details.md`](../tasks/m5_21_9_task_details.md). Pre-gate verify (the author's negative-δ suggestion): [`m5_21_9_negdelta_note.md`](m5_21_9_negdelta_note.md). Base instruments: the certified [M5.21.3](m5_21_3_note.md) 4D stack; the [M5.21.8](m5_21_8_note.md) dressed-family machinery; the [M5.21.6](m5_21_6_note.md) leapfrog pattern. Standard: [`METHOD_NOTE.md`](../../../../../dev_docs/METHOD_NOTE.md).

## 1. Equations first

The two-stack consensus (M5.21.3 + M5.21.8, conceded by the author 2026-07-19: "I see you are right") is that free minimization gives ω\* = 0 or −∞, never a finite clock. The construction here carries the clock as a CONSTRAINT, the standard isorotating-soliton route:

```text
E_kin = omega^2 * kin(M; a0),     a0 = the clock flow: the CONJUGATION tangent
                                  w [W, M] (W = rotation about the local leading
                                  eigenvector; unit Frobenius): the canonical
                                  convention (kin = 0.1206)
J     = dE_kin/domega = 2 omega kin          (the conserved isorotation charge)
E(J; M) = E_stat(M) + J^2 / (4 kin(M))       (fixed-J energy; Legendre of fixed-omega)
omega* = J / (2 kin)                          (the clock rate the state carries)
dE/dM |_J = grad_stat - omega*^2 * kin_grad   (descent direction; FIRE with the
                                               sign-wrapped kin term, omega* and a0
                                               refreshed every 300 iterations)
```

Acceptance (the author's own protocol): precession of the state's J-vector under a weak external field, frequency proportional to field strength. Our field implementation (author-gated conventions, OURS, flagged):

```text
M_B(x) = eps * (x T_y - y T_x),  T_i = E_{0i} + E_{i0}   (constant tilt derivatives)
F_xy(M_B) = const z-oriented block ~ eps^2                (B_meas = its eta-norm)
dynamics: M_tt = -grad E / h^3 - gamma(r) M_t             (4x4 leapfrog, M5.21.6 form:
                                                           velocity masked to free cells,
                                                           implicit gamma, dt = 0.005)
observable: J_k(t) = <M_t, a_rot_k>  (k = x, y, z);  Omega = d(phi_xy)/dt vs B_meas
```

## 3. P0: the δ < 0 lattice rung (the author's suggestion on the grid)

| Read | Result |
| --- | --- |
| E(m) landscape at δ = −0.3 (g = 8, n = 32) | ✅ twin interior minima at \|m\| ≈ 0.15 grid (parabolic fit 0.139), matching the audited analytic minimum 0.1508 from the pre-gate pass within grid resolution; curve exactly even in m; E_v ~ 1e-22 (pinning exact on the family) |
| kin at the minima | +39.9 (POSITIVE → the free ω-minimum stays 0, consistent with the analytics); audit sharpening: the kin sign flip sits at \|m\| ≈ 0.154, only ~0.003 above the analytic minimum 0.1508: a THIN positive margin, worth watching at other (g, δ) |
| ⚠️ the sub-vacuum flag | E_u(m\*) = −6.54: the δ < 0 family is the first with a BELOW-VACUUM static minimum (the boost channel's negative contribution exceeds the spatial curvature there); E(m) still bounded in m (+5723 at \|m\| = 0.35) |
| FIRE relax survival | ❌ **DIES, same as +δ** (E_u → −6.3e266): free per-voxel descent leaves the ansatz family through the BOOST channel; V4 = 0 on the whole boosted family, so the potential never resists. The δ < 0 boundedness is a property of the author's ansatz family, not of free lattice descent |

## 4. P1: the core-profile question is MOOT for the lattice program

The one author-gated regularization left (fork (a): "which radius dependence?") was tested by blending the vortex axis toward its azimuthal average (tanh profile, r_c = 3.0) before relaxing: the profiled family dies IDENTICALLY (non-finite, boost channel). Profile-independence demonstrated: the core profile choice matters to the analytic family's cone term (where the pre-gate pass showed δ < 0 flips it to positive core mass) but does NOT decide lattice relaxability. The author's open profile question therefore does not block anything we run.

## 5. P2: the fixed-J electron EXISTS and HOLDS on the certified state

Arena decision (deviation logged at run time): the build lives on the certified M5.21.3 s = −1 endpoint (V4 fires off-spectrum there; the boosted family is V4-flat and collapses).

**The convention catch and re-base (2026-07-20, self-caught at the doc sweep)**: the first pass used `gen_catalog`'s flow, which is the ANTISYMMETRIC probe tangent that the canonical's own anti-recipe table already rules out for physical inertia ("exits the configuration space"; kin_probe = 0.297 vs the adopted conjugation value 0.1206, the audit's CL9 flag). The family was therefore RERUN on the CONJUGATION tangent a0 = w·[W, M] (symmetric, in-space, kin0 = 0.12055 = the canonical value): the family of record below. The probe-family JSONs stay on disk as the internal-consistency record (its Legendre also closed, confirming the closure is structure-not-convention). Consequence for the dynamics runs (§ 6): their Mt(0) used the probe flow, whose antisymmetric part the integrator's sym4 projection silently removed: the J-azimuth observable partially tracked a spectator component: a SECOND root cause of the Larmor-read failure, folded into the redesign. J set via the ω target: J = 2·kin·ω.

The family of record (conjugation tangent, 1200 iterations each):

| Rung | Result |
| --- | --- |
| ω = 0.2 (J = 0.0482) | HOLDS: rel_move 1.18e-4, ω\*_final = 0.19923, kin_final 0.12101, core spectrum [0.0259, 0.2828, 0.9937, 8.000] |
| ω = 0.5 (J = 0.1205) | HOLDS: rel_move 1.18e-4, ω\*_final = 0.49655, kin_final 0.12139, core intact |
| ω = 1.0 (J = 0.2411) | HOLDS with the textbook isorotating-soliton response: kin dresses UP 0.12055 → 0.12275 (the state spreads slightly to cheapen rotation), ω\* self-adjusts 1.0 → 0.98204, core intact |

(Probe-family consistency record, first pass: the same hold pattern at kin 0.297-0.304 with its own Legendre closure 0.996/0.989; one disclosure carried from it: the ω = 0.2 rung needed a full-depth rerun after a stop-string bug left it at 300 iterations, which had contaminated the first Legendre difference at ratio 0.32.)

Statics-grade Larmor input measured en route: on the PROBE flow the axial-twist linear response is b = 0 exactly; on the CONJUGATION tangent it is NONZERO (b = 5.98e-4): a static torque channel exists on the physical flow after all, a candidate statics-grade element for the round-3 Larmor instrument alongside the ramp-on redesign.

## 6. P3: the Larmor read

Instrument gates (try cap 3, pre-registered): tries 1 and 2 FAILED (49.8% / 12.5% drift); try 3 = the M5.21.6 leap_step form exactly: **GL4a E_tot drift 2.2e-8 over 400 steps ✅; GL4b J-direction held to 0.04% with no external field ✅.** Audit correction adopted: BOTH failures were the same pinned-shell velocity-mask bug (the audit's masked integrator conserves at 1.6e-6 even at dt = 0.02): dt was never the problem, so future runs can take 4x the step. Disclosure: the gates ran on the pre-rerun base state; the certificate transfers to the re-relaxed base by construction (same integrator, same arena), not by re-measurement.

| Read | Result |
| --- | --- |
| The control floor (ε = 0, both bases) | Ω₀ = 9.06e-4 / 9.23e-4 (old / re-relaxed base). Audit sharpening adopted: the drift is NOT clean-linear: it ACCELERATES (windowed slope 3.7e-4 → 1.37e-3 across the window; the linear-fit residual is 14% of the total advance). Any future rate read needs a MODELED floor (fit the drift shape), not a linear fit |
| The perturbative ladder (ε ≤ 0.01, B ≤ 1.4e-4) | No LINEAR response anywhere (that null stands). Audit upgrade adopted: base-MATCHED, the ladder DOES resolve a clean QUADRATIC (ε²) drift slowdown: −8.8e-7 / −6.2e-6 / −2.54e-5 at ε = 0.002 / 0.005 / 0.01, continuing through −1.84e-4 at env ε = 0.03: **the first resolved, reproducible field coupling of the run** (field-strength-even, so NOT Larmor; a real magnetic-response channel to characterize) |
| The saturation boundary (raw linear background) | ε ≥ 0.03 destabilizes the arena (background self-energy 8.1e5 / 9.1e7 dwarfs the state's 6.8, NaN mid-run through the V4-flat boost channel): the raw "constant everywhere" field has NO viable window between floor and blowup |
| The ENVELOPED field (localized over the core, the lab-coil configuration) | Opens a window: ε = 0.03 (B = 1.27e-3) runs STABLE (E 53.4 → 47.5). ε = 0.1 still blows up (background energy 5770) |
| Determinism + F-mediation control | The ε = −0.03 replica (background sign flipped, same F since B ∝ ε²) reproduces Ω to 1e-7 and the energy trajectory to 3 decimals: the response is field-strength-mediated and the instrument deterministic |
| The ±B differential (the pre-registered discriminator) | Ω(+B) = 8.249e-4, Ω(−B) = 6.525e-4 (commutator-reversed mirror), Ω(0) = 9.23e-4 (same base). Symmetric part −1.84e-4 (the quadratic channel above); antisymmetric part +0.86e-4. AUDIT REINTERPRETATION ADOPTED: the antisymmetric component is NOT a constant rate: it grows with time (+0.5e-5 early, +3.6e-5 mid, +2.9e-4 late = a trajectory-divergence signature), the reversed background is a SHEAR-type texture rather than a symmetry image (1.09-unit static cross-coupling difference: it prepares a different initial condition), and the "E_end 47.5 vs 10.9" asymmetry is potential-only (E+KE totals 53.3 vs 52.2: the reversed run rings). So γ ≈ 0.068 is an ARTIFACT-SCALE UPPER BOUND, not a candidate measurement |
| The honest grade | 🔶 the LINEAR (Larmor) read is UNRESOLVED this round: not measured, and not refuted either: the audit's own static-texture discriminator came back NULL in our favor (reversed field on the ω = 0 state pumps NO J: jxy < 2e-19 vs 0.017 in the rotating runs, so the simplest non-Larmor explanation is EXCLUDED). What IS established: the instrument (2.2e-8 conservation, dt-margin 4× after the mask-bug exoneration), the modeled-floor requirement, the saturation map, the quadratic channel, and the protocol. Designed next discriminators (queued, not run): (1) the audit's J-FLIP run (env0.03 with Mt(0) = −ω\*a0: a genuine Larmor rate is J-sign-even while the drift and relaxation channels flip, one run separates them with no texture confound); (2) the ± pair ladder with modeled-floor fits and phase advance > 1 cycle (everything this round was sub-cycle, ~9e-3 rad total): native on the [M5.26](../tasks/m5_26_task_details.md) production port |

## 7. P4: the clock thermodynamics ✅ dE/dJ = ω\* at the ~1% level

The Legendre identity dE/dJ = ω\* is the machine-checkable clock consistency on the fixed-J family (the conjugate-variable read: the clock rate IS the energy cost of angular momentum). Three rungs at equal convergence depth (1200 iterations each):

| Interval (the conjugation family of record) | dE/dJ (finite difference) | ω\*_mid (measured) | ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| J: 0.0482 → 0.1205 (ω 0.199 → 0.497) | 0.34686 | 0.34789 | **0.997** |
| J: 0.1205 → 0.2411 (ω 0.497 → 0.982) | 0.73333 | 0.73930 | **0.992** |

(The probe family independently closes at 0.996 / 0.989: the conjugacy is a property of the constrained-family STRUCTURE, not of the tangent convention.)

The constructed family behaves as an exact thermodynamic clock family: E(J) = E_stat + J²/(4kin) with its own measured conjugacy closing to ~1%. This is the verified-L clock re-read at the family level: on the certified stack, the clock rate the electron carries is exactly the derivative of its energy with respect to its spin charge.

## 8. The theory backbone (the [Q35](../m5_question_tracker.md#q35-detail) mini-pass; all citations web-verified 2026-07-20)

The fixed-J construction is the STANDARD route to rotating solitons in the literature, not an improvisation. Verified anchor set (sub-agent sweep, 8/8 verified; full task = [M5.21.12](../tasks/m5_21_12_task_details.md)):

| Reference | What it establishes for us |
| --- | --- |
| Coleman, "Q-balls", Nucl. Phys. B 262 (1985) 263 | The template: stationary rotation exists ONLY as a critical point of E at fixed conserved charge; the frequency is the Lagrange multiplier (our ω\* = J/2kin = dE/dJ) |
| Battye, Krusch, Sutcliffe, Phys. Lett. B 626 (2005) 120, hep-th/0507279 | Spinning Skyrmions at fixed spin with field deformation beyond rigid-rotor: our kin dressing (0.297 → 0.304 at ω = 1) is exactly the deformable correction |
| Battye, Haberichter, Phys. Rev. D 88, 125016 (2013), arXiv:1309.3907 | Isospinning baby Skyrmions relaxed at fixed J including the critical-ω breakdown: the (2+1)d precedent for this run |
| Radu, Volkov, Phys. Rept. 468 (2008) 101, arXiv:0804.1357 | The review-level statement: spinning Q-balls / Skyrmions are built as stationary solutions under a conserved-quantity constraint, never as free energy minima over ω |
| Woodard, Scholarpedia 10(8):32243, arXiv:1506.02210 (+ Ostrogradsky 1850) | The standard language for the ω → −∞ sector: an indefinite direction is handled by constraint or degeneracy, not free minimization |
| Schoen, Yau, Commun. Math. Phys. 65 (1979) 45; Witten, Commun. Math. Phys. 80 (1981) 381 | The author's own pointer (GR): indefinite-sign energy DENSITY does not imply global instability; positivity lives at the conserved global quantity |

Synthesis for the outbound: our measured ω\* = 0 / −∞ dichotomy is precisely what the Ostrogradsky language predicts for an indefinite sector, and the constraint-carried clock is what Coleman-through-Radu-Volkov prescribe; the author's "maybe enforced if numerical problems remain" is, in the literature's terms, the correct and standard construction, not a fallback.

## 6b. ROUND 2 (the addendum, 2026-07-20 afternoon): the discriminators run, the linear read closed as unmeasurable here

User-directed addendum before closeout. Instruments upgraded first: the dt = 0.02 step certified on our leapfrog (drift 1.69e-7 per 400 steps), unlocking 8× windows.

| Read | Result |
| --- | --- |
| The J-flip discriminator (the audit's proposal) | RETIRED AS A DISCRIMINATOR by its own result, and the round-2 audit sharpened it to machine precision: Ω identical to 1.6e-13 relative, E row-by-row to 1.8e-15, φ_flip = φ + π to 3.3e-16, J_flip = −J to 3.5e-18: the flipped run IS the same trajectory under an exact symmetry map, zero independent information on the precession sign |
| The modeled-floor ± pair ladder (ε = 0.02, 0.03 pairs + control; 4000 steps, dt = 0.02, t = 80) | DECISIVE on the pre-registered rule, branch (b): all FOUR field runs go non-finite by t ≈ 10-12 (audit sharpening: two are corrupted BEFORE the NaN, so usable field-on data ends at t ≤ 8-10: with a field on the arena has a finite lifetime; round 1's "stable" window simply ended at t = 10), and on the surviving prefix the pair difference Δφ(t) ACCELERATES with split-half slope ratios 34× (ε = 0.02) and 40× (ε = 0.03): the texture-preparation divergence signature, not a constant rate. Audit attack on the alternative: a constant-rate-plus-noise model FAILS (quadratic beats linear at F = 24.9 / 21.0 vs F_crit 7.71; the fitted linear terms are wrong-signed and miss the 2.25× B ratio) |
| The bonus hold read | The ε = 0 control ran the FULL t = 80 finite (E 6.74 → 5.54, sponge bleed of the initial transient only): the fixed-J state's first LONG dynamics-grade hold: the core survives 80 time units of free evolution |
| **The round-2 verdict** | The Larmor LINEAR read is UNMEASURABLE in this instrument configuration (instant-on boundary/envelope-fed background + J-azimuth tracking): the dominant systematic is the preparation-texture divergence, and it grows faster than any candidate rate at every accessible field strength. Try budget spent (raw → enveloped → ± pairs → J-flip → long-window ladder); stopped per the goal-loop discipline |
| The designed round-3 instrument (documented, not run) | Kill the artifact at its root: ADIABATIC RAMP-ON of the field (both ± runs start from the IDENTICAL fieldless state; ε(t) rises smoothly over ~5 time units) + a body-frame read (track the core-spectrum axis rather than the J azimuth). Natural home: the [M5.26](../tasks/m5_26_task_details.md) production port, where long ramped runs are native |

One more audit-supplied fact worth its own line: the FIELDLESS control's azimuth drift (9.30e-4) EXCEEDS the round-1 candidate "signal" (8.249e-4): every single-run linear read in this observable was background-dominated even at B = 0.

Audit (round 2, light refits): § 10b.

## 9. Not computed

| Item | Why |
| --- | --- |
| The containment film | physics-first (user 2026-07-20): films ride [M5.21.4]; the render demo rides [M5.26]/[M5.25] after the RENDERING UNLOCK |
| The dressed-family fixed-J at δ < 0 | free descent collapses before the constraint can act (§ 3); revisit only if the author supplies a boost-resisting potential term |
| ħ/2 absolute calibration | needs the unit bridge ([M5.21.11](../tasks/m5_21_11_task_details.md)); this run delivers the instrument, the floor, and the candidate proportionality structure |
| The Q33 g-ladder of the fixed-J state | not run this round (the Larmor arc consumed the window); the [Q33](../m5_question_tracker.md#q33-detail) rung report from this task: the fixed-J construction itself is g-agnostic (E(J) = E_stat + J²/4kin at any g), so the bridge question reduces to how kin scales with g, measurable on the existing g-ladder machinery in a follow-up |
| The full ± pair Larmor ladder (the measurement-grade read) | designed (§ 6 honest-grade row); rides the next round or the [M5.26](../tasks/m5_26_task_details.md) production port |

## 10. Audit ✅ (independent adversarial; 3 CONFIRMED, 6 NUANCE adopted, 0 refuted)

Auditor: independent agent, own fits + own 4x4 arithmetic + own leapfrog + own discriminator runs; imports limited to the certified base stacks. Script: [`m5_21_9_b_audit.py`](https://github.com/openwave-labs/openwave/blob/main/openwave/xperiments/m5_liquid_crystal/research/scripts/m5_21_9_b_audit.py); verdicts: `data/m5_21_9_audit.json`.

| Claim | Verdict | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CL1 P0 statics | 🔶 NUANCE adopted | own recompute exact (E_u(0.15) = −6.5351, kin +39.918, even to 1e-14, E_v ≤ 3.2e-21); the kin flip is at \|m\| ≈ 0.154, a thin ~0.003 margin over the minimum (§ 3) |
| CL2 relax deaths | ✅ CONFIRMED | both die identically (E_u_end equal to 8e-9 rel); own probes: boost dressing leaves E_v at 1.8e-22 while an off-spectrum bump fires V4 by 21 orders: the boost-channel attribution stands |
| CL3 fixed-J holds | 🔶 NUANCE adopted | internal consistency exact; own kin on the endpoint npz to 3.2e-9; the quoted ω\*(0.2) corrected to the full-depth 0.19923 (§ 5) |
| CL4 Legendre | ✅ CONFIRMED | ratios 0.9960 / 0.9889 reproduce exactly; fragility disclosed: all rungs stop at max_iter with E_v still falling ~0.015/300 it, so the closure leans on equal-depth cancellation |
| CL5 gates | 🔶 NUANCE adopted | drift 2.228e-8 reproduced on an OWN leapfrog (2.29e-8); the try-2 bug reproduced quantitatively (12.48% vs 12.5%); try-1 attribution REFUTED: masked dt = 0.02 conserves at 1.6e-6, both failures were the mask bug (§ 6) |
| CL6 floor + ladder | 🔶 NUANCE adopted | floors reproduce; no linear response stands; but the floor ACCELERATES (not linear) and the base-matched ladder resolves the ε² quadratic slowdown the note had undersold (§ 6, promoted to a finding) |
| CL7 saturation | ✅ CONFIRMED | raw E0 8.12e5 / 9.12e7 with NaN rows; env0.03 stable, env0.1 not |
| CL8 the differential | 🔶 NUANCE adopted, the big one | all numbers reproduce (asym +8.62e-5, replica BIT-identical); but the time signature + the shear-texture asymmetry + the E+KE accounting downgrade γ ≈ 0.068 from candidate to artifact-scale upper bound (§ 6). The auditor's own static-texture discriminator (X1) came back NULL in the construction's favor |
| CL9 kin convention | 🔶 NUANCE adopted | 0.297 (probe) vs the M5.21.3-adopted 0.1206 (conjugation): a factor 2.46 into any ABSOLUTE calibration, flagged author-facing (§ 5); ratios unaffected |

Audit extras adopted throughout: the sub-cycle caveat (total phase advance ~9e-3 rad: window choice moves Ω ~4×), the replica-proves-determinism-not-F-mediation precision, and the J-flip discriminator as the cheapest next test.

### 10b. Round-2 audit (light, independent refits of the saved rows): 4/4 CONFIRMED

Script: [`m5_21_9_c_audit_r2.py`](https://github.com/openwave-labs/openwave/blob/main/openwave/xperiments/m5_liquid_crystal/research/scripts/m5_21_9_c_audit_r2.py); verdicts: `data/m5_21_9_audit_r2.json`.

| Claim | Verdict | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 field-run death vs control survival | ✅ + 2 sharpenings | finite-row counts match; two field runs corrupt BEFORE the NaN (usable data t ≤ 8-10); the control's E decline oscillates (16/40 upticks, max +0.116), a trend not a monotone |
| R2 the accelerating pair difference | ✅ | split-half ratios 34.01× / 39.68× reproduced independently |
| R3 the J-flip symmetry image | ✅ STRONGER | machine-precision identity (1.6e-13 / 1.8e-15 / 3.3e-16 / 3.5e-18): the same trajectory under a symmetry map |
| R4 the final verdict survives attack | ✅ | constant-rate-plus-noise fails the F-test (24.9 / 21.0 vs 7.71); wrong-signed linear terms; the B-ratio check misses; plus the new fact: the fieldless drift exceeds the round-1 candidate signal |
