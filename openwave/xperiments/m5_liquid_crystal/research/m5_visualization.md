# M5 visualization standards

The single source for the M5 research visualization conventions: film-strip templates, title/time standards, and the snapshot-instrument catalog. Implementation: [`scripts/m5_film.py`](scripts/m5_film.py) (the standard API) + [`scripts/m5_21_a_snap.py`](scripts/m5_21_a_snap.py) (the reusable snapshot instrument, built at [M5.21](tasks/m5_21_task_details.md)). Adopted 2026-07-14 (during the [M5.20.3](tasks/m5_20_3_task_details.md) run); it SUPERSEDES the 2026-07-14-morning per-series presentation boundary (M5.20 series = seed/endpoint maps only, M5.21 series = its own film format): both series now emit film strips from the shared template set.

## Film strips

A film strip is a grid: **one row per snapshot (time), one column per plot defined by the TEMPLATE**. Rendered by `m5_film.film_strip(states, path, template=..., ...)`.

### Templates

| Template | Columns (left to right) | Lineage / use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `basic` | \|M13\| (magma) · max spatial eigenvalue s (viridis) · log10 \|energy density\| (inferno) | the M5.20-series cross-section format (`m5_20_1_endpoints.png` era); the cross-series DEFAULT: winding structure + order parameter + energy localization at a glance |
| `thermal` | glyphs (director + δ-tick clock) · A (spectral amplitude) · clock (phase) · energy · charge · curl | the M5.21 panel set (`m5_21_c_film_prod.png` era); directed at thermal / energy-flow analysis: amplitude-excess, clock-phase, and transport channels |

Adding a template = one entry in `m5_film.py` + one row here.

### The standard (applies to every template)

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| First row = t = 0 | The seed state ALWAYS opens the strip (`film_strip` raises if `states[0]["t"] != 0`) |
| Title format | Every row is titled `t = <steps> steps`, plus `\| <t·time_unit_s> s` (scientific notation) when a tu → s calibration is passed. ⚠️ No anchored tu → s value exists yet in the M5 stack (the unit map is author-gated, the M5.12 A1/A2 residual): the internal model-time value is NOT shown (user call 2026-07-14); the `time_unit_s` parameter is wired and the seconds field appears the moment a calibration lands |
| Snapshot count | A parameter, default **N_SNAP = 6** (the seed + 5 shots); capture times from `m5_film.pick_frame_ts(T, n)` (evenly spaced, first = 0) |
| Blowup runs: the takeoff tail | Blowup strips use 7 rows: 1 seed + 3 quiet + 3 takeoff, log-spaced in time-to-singularity: full detail in [§ Snapshot spacing for blowup runs](#snapshot-spacing-for-blowup-runs) |
| Which series emits what | BOTH series emit `basic` strips. The M5.21 series (M5.21.1 on) emits `basic` AND `thermal`. The M5.20 series emits `basic` (its legacy seed/endpoint 2-row maps are retired for new runs) |
| State format | `states = [{"it": steps, "t": model_time, "M": (nr, nz, 4, 4) array, "V": optional velocity}]` |

### Snapshot spacing for blowup runs

(Pattern: `m5_20_3_c_production.film_one`, adopted 2026-07-14 during M5.20.3.) A finite-time blowup has two regimes with wildly different clocks: a long quiet crawl (field changes at the 1e-3 level for most of the run's life) ending in an exponential takeoff that develops within the last few hundredths of a time unit. An evenly spaced grid either misses the takeoff entirely or wastes every row on it. The standard layout:

| Rows | Content | Spacing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | the seed (t = 0, mandatory) | - |
| 1-3 | the quiet window | evenly spaced over `[0, t* − 0.08]` |
| 4-6 | the takeoff | log-spaced in time-to-singularity: dyadic offsets `{2, 1, 0}` fine snapshot intervals (default Δ_fine = 0.005 tu, i.e. t_lf − 0.01 / − 0.005 / 0) before the LAST FINITE state; the final row IS the last finite state. (First cut used `{4, 2, 0}`; at the measured σ ≈ 40-80/t the earliest tail row still read visually quiet, so the tail was tightened, 2026-07-14) |

**Why log-spacing in (t\* − t)**: the takeoff is a measured exponential, mode amplitude A(t) ≈ A₀·e^(σt) (M5.20.3 measured σ = 6.31-80.9/t depending on background and regularization). Halving the time-to-singularity per row multiplies the amplitude by a CONSTANT factor e^(σ·Δ) (≈ 1.5-2.2× per 0.01 tu at the measured rates), so the three takeoff rows read as a uniform visual growth ladder instead of one jump from quiet to catastrophe. If the ladder reads too gentle or too abrupt for a given σ, the offsets are one tuple in `film_one` (scale them to ~1/σ).

**Capture mechanics** (why one pass, not a restart): the frame states are captured in a single fine-grid evolution from t = 0 to past t\*: restarting mid-way from a stored frame with V = 0 would be a DIFFERENT trajectory (the velocity field is part of the state). A ring buffer (deque, maxlen 8) keeps the most recent finite states on the fine grid; the dyadic picks come out of it after the blowup guard trips. Cost note: this means the film pass re-runs the evolution once on the fine snapshot grid; at 64×128 that is minutes, and the physics runs' own data/JSONs are untouched (the film pass is presentation-only regeneration).

**Non-blowup runs** keep the plain standard: N_SNAP = 6, evenly spaced, first row t = 0.

### Regeneration status (2026-07-14)

| Figure | Status |
| --- | --- |
| M5.20.3 cross-sections | ✅ regenerated under the standard via `python m5_20_3_c_production.py film`: `plots/m5_20_3_film_raw.png` (the raw ansatz-seed run, rel_cut 1e-2, t = 1.93: the headline anatomy) + `plots/m5_20_3_film_recipe.png` (the energy-minimized recipe seed, q = 0.5, rel_cut 1e-2, t* = 0.53); the earlier 2-row `m5_20_3_sections.png` is DELETED (it had become a duplicate of film_raw under the legacy name) |
| `plots/m5_21_c_film_prod.png` | stays in the pre-standard format: the M5.21 frame states were not persisted (the > 1 MB rule) and regeneration means re-running the production evolution: deferred to the next M5.21-series run (M5.21.1), which emits both templates natively |

## The snapshot instrument (M5.21 infra, consolidated)

Built and GV0-gated at [M5.21](tasks/m5_21_task_details.md) (`scripts/m5_21_a_snap.py`; findings: [`findings/m5_21_films.md`](findings/m5_21_films.md)). What it provides:

| Piece | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `eig_fields` / `orient` | spatial-block eigendecomposition (descending) + apolar sign-alignment of director fields |
| `splay_curl` | cylindrical splay/curl of an apolar director (hedgehog anchor: div n̂ = 2/r, gated at 3.1e-4 with an h²-truncation proof) |
| `spectral_amplitude` / `clock_phase` | the amplitude-excess channel and the δ-axis phase (mod π; rotator read-back gated at 1e-16) |
| `glyph_collections` | director glyphs with the δ-tick clock hand, activation grayscale, eigenvalue-gap glyph masking |
| `render_panels` / `film_strip` | one snapshot row / the full strip; `title_fn` hook carries the 2026-07-14 title standard (fed by `m5_film.frame_title`) |
| GV0 gate practice | validate the instrument on analytic placeholders BEFORE physics reads (the M5.21 pattern: hedgehog splay, u·r⁴/8, rotator phase/ω) |

## Other visualization conventions (standing)

| Convention | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Headless matplotlib only (`Agg`); rendering gates nothing | the headless-first decision (2026-06-07) |
| Plots embedded inline in task_details / findings (`![](path)`), never link-only | the images-inline rule (flow-level, 2026-07-03) |
| Frequency claims on plots quote the FFT bin width; band language unless the peak is resolved by ≥ 3 bins | the M5.20.x G-SPECTRUM practice |
| Trajectory plots drop the singular final snapshot (`fin[:-1]`) so scales stay readable; the singularity is reported in text | the M5.20.3 anatomy practice |
