## Current detail (from the roadmap, 2026-07-02 migration)

DONE: seed-level δ/g energy scaling + the EM/GEM boost split (06-09 addendum, `2q` Phase D/E). Residual: (a) the δ (quantum-phase) sector is DYNAMICAL (the fast ~10²¹ Hz clock), not captured by the static split, so weighing it needs the ω-dynamics; (b) the direct ω(δ) on the SETTLED state (the `2h` run_dense path, not the fresh-seed `2q_omega` scaffold); (c) the real calibration axis (fix units via Coulomb + tune LdG to rest energy), folding into NG-1/NG-3

## Spec update (2026-07-03): the Coulomb-unit axis is now the TWO-CHARGE method

Duda's reply ([`m5_4h_convo_2026.07.03.md § 3`](m5_4h_convo_2026.07.03.md)) supersedes the single-defect far-field match as the Coulomb anchor method: "two such charges in various distances", large separation = the Coulomb anchor, femtometer separation = the running coupling. First run + cross-check vs the analytic `c₂ = αħc/64π`: [`m5_17_task_details.md`](m5_17_task_details.md) phase C. Any unit-scale work here consumes that result.

**Benchmark spec (2026-07-05, from Duda's public group post, [`m5_17_convo.md`](m5_17_convo.md) entry 3):** he cited Faber's running-coupling papers as the reference bar for this calculation class (Universe 2218-1997/11/4/113 + arXiv 2604.12021). Any running-coupling claim from this task's Coulomb-unit axis benchmarks against Faber's curves EXPLICITLY (curve overlay, not just the `64π` asymptote); the M5.17 fm-scale `α_eff(d)/α` readout is the starting dataset.

## Duda 2026-07-01 — the real-calibration axis routes through M5.16

Duda ([`m5_4e_convo_2026.07.01.md`](m5_4e_convo_2026.07.01.md)) restated the calibration order: **the first step is establishing `g`, `δ`** ("seems we still don't know"), with δ from the QED Lagrangian, Coulomb as a second anchor, `g` from the electron clock / neutrino oscillations / else baryon gravitational mass ("certain of only for baryons"). His method for it is a **static energy-minimization** run at the physical regime with a regularizing potential, under cylindrical symmetry.

That method is now its own task, [`m5_16_task_details.md`](m5_16_task_details.md) (graduating the M5.11-P0 minimizer to the physical `g~1e10, δ~1e-10` regime). **Residual (c) above — the real calibration axis — is delivered by M5.16**: this task (M5.9.0) consumes M5.16's locked `(g, δ, V-coeffs)` to weigh the δ/g sectors at the physical scale, rather than the seed-level `2q` proxy. See [`../m5_summary_report.md`](../m5_summary_report.md) (DUDA follow-up) for the prior δ/g findings.
