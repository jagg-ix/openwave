# M5.20 convo record (the program thread, continued: the spectrum directive)

Per-task convo record (technical exchange, no author-private content, so tracked in-repo per the convo-records rule). Outbound context: the M5.20 close message sent 2026-07-11 morning with the method-note link ([`../findings/m5_20_method_note.md`](../findings/m5_20_method_note.md)); tracker registry [`../m5_question_tracker.md`](../m5_question_tracker.md); predecessor exchange [`m5_19_convo.md`](m5_19_convo.md). Successor task planned from this entry: [M5.20.1](m5_20_1_task_details.md).

## 2026-07-11: Duda's replies to the M5.20 note: the (1, delta, 0) spectrum directive (spec for M5.20.1)

**From**: Jarek Duda, 2026-07-11, two replies to Rodrigo (12:59 and 14:27 EDT), 1:1 on the thread.

### Verbatim core (his 14:27 reply, after reading the note; the 12:59 first reaction asked "the vortex loop does not radiate, but still collapses? How is it happening?" and confirmed "The negative term is from Hamiltonian we have agreed to")

> I have just read the note, but still don't know what does it mean by "unwinds"?
>
> Topological vortex is topologically protected - to be destroyed would need to shorten to zero, what means energy difference - would need radiation mechanism, you say is not allowed.
>
> There is mentioned (1,0,0) spectrum, while topological vortex requires potential with (1, delta, 0) minimum - preferred three different, which should regularize to two equal in center - to prevent discontinuity of infinite energy, activating potential.
>
> So maybe there is problem with assumed simpler spectrum.
> Also clock propulsion with negative Hamiltonian terms require full 4x4 tensor field with (g, 1, delta, 0) spectrum.

### Decode + routing (per the unknowns discipline; evidence, not resolution, until measured)

| Item | Decode | Routing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "does not radiate, but still collapses - how?" | A legibility gap on "unwinds", not an objection: his mental model is R → 0 shrinkage (needs energy export). The measured mechanism is local spectral deformation: the cross-section passes through two-equal-eigenvalue configurations until the winding is gone in place; PE converts to the localized remnant, nothing radiates | Answered in the same-day outbound (below); wording lesson for future notes: define "unwinds" up front |
| "(1,0,0) spectrum, while topological vortex requires (1, delta, 0) minimum - three different" | The load-bearing catch: at δ = 0 the two lower eigenvalues are ALREADY equal in vacuum, so the two-equal face is potential-free (M5.19 B2 measured "the two-equal core is nearly free"; the M5.20 vacuum Hessian's 4 zero modes include the 2 pair-splitting directions, gapped only at quartic order). His diagnosis names exactly the channel the unwinding used. At δ ≠ 0 the pair-splitting face gets an energy gap ("activating potential") and the vacuum manifold topology changes (π₁ = Q₈, no free escape) | Machine-checkable → **[M5.20.1](m5_20_1_task_details.md)** (the δ ≠ 0 rerun). Tracker [Q22](../m5_question_tracker.md#q22-detail) REOPENED: his "I don't know in this moment" (2026-07-10) is superseded by a structural directive (the vortex sector requires δ ≠ 0); the VALUE stays unknown |
| "maybe there is problem with assumed simpler spectrum" | Correct reading of M5.20's scope: the verdict is a statement about the δ = 0 theory (his electron-sector spec, run because Q22 was parked-unknown and disclosed in the note § 4). Not a computational bug: the audit stands; the theory he intends is different and now testable | The M5.20 record keeps its licensed close sentence unchanged (in-scope); M5.20.1 tests the intended theory |
| "clock propulsion ... require full 4x4 tensor field with (g, 1, delta, 0) spectrum" | Confirms the clock sector needs the time eigenvalue g in the potential AND the time/kinetic term (the negative `Γ·Γ̃` contributions, "from Hamiltonian we have agreed to" per his 12:59 line, i.e. the M5.18-verified 4D Lagrangian) | Tracker [Q23](../m5_question_tracker.md#q23-detail) rider added; the clock stays out of M5.20.1 scope unless the M-variable time term arrives |

### Same-day outbound (Rodrigo, 16:07 EDT): the "unwinds" explanation + the M5.20.1 seed round

The reply (drafted per the message-drafting rule) explained the unwinding mechanism in his core-regularization language, conceded the spectrum point with the measured evidence (exact-zero two-equal face at δ = 0, the 4 zero modes), framed M5.20 as the δ = 0 verdict, announced the (1, δ, 0) rerun with a δ sweep, and asked three questions:

| # | Question | Tracker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | δ value or range for the neutrino sector, or bless the sweep {0.1, 0.3, 0.5} | [Q22](../m5_question_tracker.md#q22-detail) (value half) |
| 2 | Which eigenvalue pair carries the cross-section winding (the (1, δ) pair regularizing to two-equal at center?) | [Q22](../m5_question_tracker.md#q22-detail) (pairing half) |
| 3 | Is spatial (1, δ, 0) enough for the protection question, or do the negative clock terms act already at the loop level (then we need the time term in M variables) | [Q23](../m5_question_tracker.md#q23-detail) |

**Process note (standing from this message on)**: the outbound debuted the **voice separation format**: a `RODRIGO VOICE` section (his own words: intent, workflow, relationship) and a `FABLE VOICE` section (the technical body, first-person plural "we"), so the author can weigh the two sources explicitly. All future Duda-channel drafts follow it.

## 2026-07-12: the seed round answered overnight: "start with (1, δ, 0)", the equalization mechanism, and the regularization ladder

**From**: Jarek Duda, 2026-07-12 00:06 EDT (~8h after the seed round), 1:1 on the thread.

### Verbatim core

> Thank you, it goes in right direction - the problem was indeed assuming delta=0 everywhere, for which there is no topological vortex.
>
> Instead, it is crucial that minimum of potential has different eigenvalues - in 3D (1, delta,0) you can start with, but finally to get oscillations requires full 4x4 tensor with potential preferring (1,g,delta,0) eigenvalues.
>
> Energy minimization has to equalize 2 eigenvalues in the center of vortex to prevent discontinuity of infinite energy - regularization to finite energy by activating potential.
>
> Later modeling charges analogously 3 spatial eigenvalues have to be equalized in the center to regularize singularity ... and if modeling black holes, all 4 eigenvalues should equalize in its center for finite energy.

### Decode + routing (folded into the [M5.20.1](m5_20_1_task_details.md) plan same day, per its folding table)

| Item | Decode | Routing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "goes in right direction - the problem was indeed assuming delta=0 everywhere, for which there is no topological vortex" | The M5.20 reading CONFIRMED by the author: δ = 0 verdict stands, no computational objection; the δ = 0 sector has no protected vortex (matches the measured potential-free two-equal face) | M5.20 record unchanged; M5.20.1 premise author-confirmed |
| "in 3D (1, delta, 0) you can start with" | Seed-round **Q3 ANSWERED, the no-scope-change branch**: the spatial (1, δ, 0) run is the sanctioned START for the protection question; no clock term needed at this level. Also the folding-table Q1 outcome: no δ value given, so the sweep stands | M5.20.1 runs as planned (folding row "spatial is enough"); the canonical-kinetic-term flag softens from "our assumption" to "his sanctioned starting sector" ([Q23](../m5_question_tracker.md#q23-detail) loop-level half answered) |
| "finally to get oscillations requires full 4x4 tensor with potential preferring (1,g,delta,0)" | The recurring 4×4 directive now has a defined PLACE: not this run, the SUCCESSOR (oscillations = the clock sector). Note we HAVE the 4×4 assets: the engine substrate is 4×4 `D = diag(g,1,δ,0)` since M5.8.1 (`medium.py`, MDIM = 4), the M5.18-verified 4D Lagrangian, the spectral potential pins `(g,1,δ,0)` exactly, and a constrained 4D integrator exists (M5.8.2c). What blocks the oscillation RUN is well-posedness, not machinery: the degenerate Legendre map ([Q18](../m5_question_tracker.md#q18-detail)) + indefinite H + branch choice ([Q19](../m5_question_tracker.md#q19-detail)) + the time term in M variables ([Q23](../m5_question_tracker.md#q23-detail)). His "(1,g,delta,0)" here is read as a MISSPELLING of the standing (g, 1, δ, 0) (user call 2026-07-12: matches his own 07-11 "(g, 1, delta, 0)", his repeated reinforcement of the 4×4 spec, and the engine convention `D = diag(g, 1, δ, 0)`); the spectral potential pins the SET via Tr-power targets, and the timelike assignment is exactly Q19 | Successor stub **M5.20.2** added to the roadmap Backlog (gated by Q23/Q18/Q19 + the M5.20.1 verdict); the M5.20.1 method note gets a FIELD CONTENT box stating all of this up front (the legibility fix for the repeated directive) |
| "Energy minimization HAS TO equalize 2 eigenvalues in the center ... activating potential" | The two-equal core is not a seed CHOICE, it is the predicted OUTCOME of minimization at δ ≠ 0. Consequence: which pair equalizes should be MEASURED, not only imposed: seed both pairings, let statics/dynamics select, read the core spectrum `λ_i(ρ→0)` per run | M5.20.1 DoD gains the **core-equalization diagnostic** (the measured answer to the seed-round Q2 / [Q22](../m5_question_tracker.md#q22-detail) pairing half, which his reply left unnamed) |
| "charges: 3 spatial eigenvalues equalized in the center ... black holes: all 4 equalize" | The REGULARIZATION LADDER: vortex = 2-equal core, charge = 3-equal spatial core, black hole = 4-equal core. Retroactively consistent with his 2026-07-06 charge-core prescription `M = aI` (3D) / `(g', a, a, a)` (4D): that IS the 3-spatial-equal core | Recorded here as the program map (charges = the M5.12-line re-run home; black holes = far future); no task change now |

**Reply posture (user call, 2026-07-12 morning)**: the drafted FABLE VOICE reply is HELD until the M5.20.1 runs complete; the next outbound carries the results AND explicitly reinforces the 4×4 usage (the FIELD CONTENT statement: full 4×4 substrate since M5.8.1, this run = his sanctioned spatial start, the 4×4 oscillation run = M5.20.2).

**Same-day group email (separate thread, models-of-particles, 03:02 EDT)**: Duda circulated the AMBer paper (Baretz et al. 2026, Commun. Phys. 9:227: RL agent + physics-software pipeline searching neutrino flavor-symmetry model space) with "We are not the only ones - maybe let's try to work together before being overrun". Different framework (seesaw flavor fitting, not topological solitons); assessed + cited as methodological context and as the lepton-observables scoreboard any eventual 4×4 oscillation sector must fit ([`../../theory/_CITATIONS.md`](../../theory/_CITATIONS.md), local copy `amber_neutrino_flavor_rl.pdf`). Strategic read: his urgency about agent-driven model search is rising; the grounded-collaborator channel we run is exactly his proposed response.

## 2026-07-12 afternoon: both runs closed same-day; the combined answer + the one question drafted

**Outbound posture**: M5.20.1 (the (1, δ, 0) protection verdict) and M5.20.2 (the 4×4 clock sector) both closed and review-approved 2026-07-12. Per the user's delivery call: ONE email, ONE method note ([`../findings/m5_20_2_method_note.md`](../findings/m5_20_2_method_note.md), Part I + Part II + both audits), ONE question. The FABLE VOICE block was wrapped in Rodrigo's voice (biography-only motivation, the thermal-program boundary held per the 2026-07-12 disclosure decision) and **SENT 2026-07-12 late afternoon EDT**, after the M5.20.x commit/merge to main. Awaiting his constraint answer; the next entry here records his reply.

| What goes to him | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Part I answer to his 07-11/07-12 directive | his mechanism confirmed (gap activates, 4 → 3 zero modes, measured ladder) but the gap does not protect: UNWOUND across the full grid, statics + conservative dynamics, no radiation needed, ~3% barrier-to-driving; the pairing he left to minimization is measured ((δ, 0) equalization); a persistent unwound remnant in the top-mass-line band |
| Part II answer to his 4×4 insistence | the EOM derived from HIS verified Lagrangian (purely quartic; no canonical kinetic term; K degenerate); the boost runaway measured and audit-confirmed physical; the clock quantified exactly (rotations positive, boosts negative, unbounded): "clock propulsion with negative Hamiltonian terms" is real but needs a constraint |
| THE question (Q18 + Q19 + Q23 fused) | what constraint closes the boost sector so the 4×4 oscillation run is well-posed (Dirac treatment? rotation-orbit restriction? a branch/sign choice we missed?); given it, the run goes same-day |
| Audit disclosure | both parts independently adversarially audited (own instruments); Part I headline confirmed with two presentation corrections folded; Part II six-for-six confirmed |

## 2026-07-12 evening: quick acknowledgment: the ansatz restated, a ≈ δ/2 named, the radius-oscillation mechanism; deeper reply promised for his morning

**From**: Jarek Duda, 2026-07-12 18:19 EDT, 1:1 on the thread. A quick pass ("Will look closer and respond in ~6 hours (my morning)"): the constraint question (our ONE question) is NOT yet answered; this entry records what the quick pass already gives.

### Verbatim core

> The "holds the (delta, 0)" suggests there is some manual choice of eigenspectrum, while everything should come from energy minimization.
>
> Once again, there is potential with minimum in 3D: Lambda = (1,delta, 0), e.g. V(M) = sum_p (Tr(M^p) - c_p)^2 for c_p = sum_i (Lambda_i)^p and summation over 3. In 4D: Lambda = (g, 1,delta, 0) and summation over 4.
>
> So far from particles eigespectrum is (g, 1,delta, 0) minimum called vacuum, in the center of vortex should automatically get some intermediate spectrum with 2 equal eigenvalues, e.g. (g,1, a,a) for a ~ delta/2.
>
> [ellipse-field diagram] Like in this diagram with eigenvalues being radii of ellipses, eigenvectors being their axes - potential prefers elongated ellipse of fixed radii, but in the center for continuity it needs to become circle of two equal intermediate radii, at cost of activating potential (grayness). Everything is optimized to minimize total energy (integral of Hamiltonian).
>
> During neutrino oscillation, radius of loop can also oscillate - I suspect to maintain total energy, which is density per length depending on flavor, times loop length.

Attachment: the same half-integer vortex ellipse-field diagram already on file from the M5.12 round ([`../images/m5_12_duda_ansatz.png`](../images/m5_12_duda_ansatz.png)); no new figure content.

### Decode + routing

| Item | Decode | Routing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "manual choice of eigenspectrum ... everything should come from energy minimization" | A wording gap in our note, not a physics gap: "holds the (δ, 0) equalization" read as imposed. The measurement was FREE: both pairings seeded symmetrically, the endpoint core spectrum selected by the dynamics alone | Next outbound clarifies in one sentence (seeds imposed nothing at the endpoint; minimization selected (δ, 0)). Wording lesson, same family as "unwinds": say "the dynamics SELECTS", never "holds" |
| the potential restated ("once again"): V = Σ_p (Tr M^p − c_p)², c_p = Σ_i λ_i^p; 3D (1, δ, 0) p ≤ 3, 4D (g, 1, δ, 0) p ≤ 4 | Already implemented VERBATIM: M5.20.1 `c_p = 1 + δ^p`, M5.20.2 `C_p = g^p + 1 + δ^p`. The "once again" is the same legibility loop as the FIELD CONTENT box: he cannot yet see from our note that his formula IS the code | Next outbound points at the exact code lines (already in the combined note's code map) and states the identity explicitly, closing the loop |
| "in the center ... automatically ... 2 equal eigenvalues, e.g. (g, 1, a, a) for a ~ delta/2" | FIRST TIME the core value is named: a ≈ δ/2. The M5.20.1 measured selected core IS (1, δ/2, δ/2) (the (δ, 0)-equalized pair, pair_d0 construction (1, δ/2, δ/2) chosen by the dynamics from both seedings): his prediction CONFIRMED by the already-sent measurement | Next outbound states the match (his prediction → our measurement, genuine at δ ≥ 0.3 per the audit caveat). The eventual 4×4 run gains a pre-registered core gate: endpoint core reads (g, 1, a, a), a ≈ δ/2 |
| "radius of loop can also oscillate - I suspect to maintain total energy, which is density per length depending on flavor, times loop length" | NEW mechanism spec for the oscillation run: flavor ↔ linear energy density; loop radius R(t) breathes so that E_total = (E/length)(flavor) × 2πR stays conserved. Concrete observable set: E per unit length vs core-spectrum state, R(t), and the exchange between them | Folds into the [M5.20.3](m5_20_3_task_details.md) plan as the primary observable set (alongside the staged H(ω) machinery and the AMBer scoreboard); the run itself stays gated on his constraint answer |
| "respond in ~6 hours (my morning)" + he asked that results reach him before his 20:00 (14:00 EDT) for a same-evening read | The deep analysis (and presumably the constraint answer) arrives ≈ our midnight. Comms window recorded as standing logistics | [M5.20.3](m5_20_3_task_details.md) stays PLAN-ready (plan written same evening, roadmap row at the top of Backlog), production HELD for the morning email; the next outbound opens with a brief timing apology (user call 2026-07-12) |

## 2026-07-13 late morning: outbound: the one blocking question isolated (sent inside the comms window)

**From**: Rodrigo, 2026-07-13 ~11:20 EDT (his ~17:20, inside the before-20:00 window). His promised deeper reply had not arrived by late morning; rather than wait, the outbound isolates the single blocking question so his answer can be short, and defers everything else ("full analysis ... whenever convenient, no rush"). Voice-separation format; the RODRIGO VOICE section (timing apology + no-rush framing + "everything staged") is his own words, not logged here.

### FABLE VOICE block (as sent)

> The single blocking question is the boost sector of the 4x4 dynamics. Your verified Lagrangian is purely quartic in derivatives, and on rigid Lorentz orbits we measured H(omega) = H(0) + omega^2 K_eff exactly: all three rotation generators give K_eff > 0, all three boost generators give K_eff < 0 with 100% negative density, so H is unbounded along boosts and free time integration runs away (t ~ 21, dt-robust).
>
> The question: what closes the boost sector? For example: a Dirac treatment of the primary constraint (Mdot ~ eta is an exact null direction), a restriction of the dynamics to rotation orbits, a branch or sign choice we missed, or the clock being ansatz-level rather than field-level.
>
> If the answer is simply "do not integrate freely, everything comes from energy minimization under constraints" (as your last note hints), one line saying so, plus which quantities are held fixed (winding? total energy?), is all we need. Given that input, the (g, 1, delta, 0) oscillation run goes the same day, with your core prediction (g, 1, a, a), a ~ delta/2 pre-registered as a gate, and the loop-radius breathing at conserved total energy = (energy per length) x (loop length) as the primary observable.
>
> Full analysis and everything else can come whenever convenient, no rush.

### Notes

| Item | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Design intent | Restates the census numbers inline so he need not reopen the method note; pre-commits to his own two predictions (the a ≈ δ/2 core gate, the radius breathing) so his answer slots straight into the staged [M5.20.3](m5_20_3_task_details.md) run; offers the minimization-first branch explicitly (the hint in his 2026-07-12 quick reply) with the two fixed-quantity candidates named (winding, total energy) |
| Tracker | The question is the standing Q18 + Q19 + Q23 fusion (no new Qn); resolution routes on his reply |
| Next | His reply → verbatim + decode entry here → the [M5.20.3](m5_20_3_task_details.md) folding-table row chosen → user "go" |

## 2026-07-13/14: THE CONSTRAINT ANSWER (three messages) + the thread goes public

His reply to the 2026-07-13 nudge came in three parts: a same-evening group-cc'd answer (2026-07-13 14:51 EDT, cc **models-of-particles**), a group thread convening the loop-identification debate (2026-07-14 02:47 EDT), and a direct technical-check email (2026-07-14 04:58 EDT). **The M5.20.3 gate is LIFTED.**

### Message 1 (2026-07-13 14:51 EDT, to the group + Rodrigo): the answer

Verbatim core:

> "Thank you, looks great! As also e.g. Marc, Andras, Giorgio use vortex loops (but with interpretation as electron instead of neutrino), they might be interested that Fable can handle their simulations: [the m5_20_2 method note link] ... so let me cc models-of-particles."
>
> "The central eigenspectrum of vortex still seems assumed, while should be found from energy minimization - at least in 3D."
>
> "In 4D indeed there are problems with negative Hamiltonian terms - both difficult to avoid in 3+1D, and seem necessary to propel neutrino oscillations or electron angular momentum."
>
> "Energy minimization assumes abundant energy was already radiated, but generally such process requires radiation mechanism and time."
>
> "Formally there should be used Euler-Lagrange evolution, and if e.g. vortex loop would reduce to R=0 and vanish this way, would be great to calculate duration of such process - which would be increased by time dilation due to neutrinos usually being ultrarelativistic."
>
> "So maybe the best would be starting with energy minimized 3D vortex loop, and extending it to 4D by adding 0th axis with g eigenvalues in time direction. Then perform its Euler-Lagrange evolution, which should stabilize leaving mostly neutrino oscillations, maybe also radiation (in neutrino rest frame) - we could compare with experimental data."
>
> "**We don't want to add artificial restrictions, everything should come from evolution of field configuration of particle using assumed Lagrangian.**"
>
> "If Euler-Lagrange would go to minus infinite energy, more appropriate but much more difficult is solving by the least action principle - fixing initial and final field configurations, like they do with S-matrix in QFT. In this view e.g. photon literally couples e.g. two electron in 4D scenario ... for neutrinos emission/absorption is e.g. beta process, but we could just use two vortex loops."

### Message 2 (2026-07-14 04:58 EDT, direct): two 3D-to-4D checks

> "For example O matrix in 3D is SO(3), while in 4D should be SO(1,3) instead of SO(4) - please check if there is assumed SO(1,3)."
>
> "Also the potential should be Lorentz invariant - requires to include eta signature in traces of powers e.g. Tr((M.eta)^p) instead of Tr(M^p), also modifying c_p. There is Tr_eta but please check if it uses eta also for products."
>
> "ps. I mention in models-of-particles to search for help, especially that you say there are only few days left with Fable."

### Message 3 (2026-07-14 02:47 EDT, to Marc, Andras, Giorgio + the group): the identification debate

> "As many of us see vortex loop crucial in models of particles, but disagree on its interpretation, maybe let's try to determine it somehow to be able to work together - if you convince me it should be electron, I will do my best to help."
>
> "You can use it e.g. replacing Lagrangian to try to get Coulomb as required for electron ... or maybe you have a different idea how to distinguish electron from neutrino?"

### Decode + routing

| Item | Decode | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| THE ANSWER: "no artificial restrictions, everything from Euler-Lagrange evolution of the assumed Lagrangian" | The folding-table branch = free EL evolution of HIS purely-quartic L (NOT our canonical completion). The degenerate Legendre map (Ṁ ∝ η exact null, M5.18 check 3) is part of HIS L, so handling it (invert K(M) on its range / project the null direction) is the theory's own constraint structure, not an artificial restriction: the Dirac-treatment row fires, amended to the quartic kinetic operator | [M5.20.3](m5_20_3_task_details.md) § The answer |
| The starting-state recipe | Energy-minimized 3D loop → extend to 4D by a block-diagonal time row with the g eigenvalue → free EL evolution | M5.20.3 phase A/B |
| Outcome taxonomy he names | (a) stabilizes → mostly neutrino oscillations + maybe rest-frame radiation → compare with experiment; (b) shrinks to R = 0 and vanishes → the DURATION is the measurable (time-dilation reading; M5.20.1's measured unwind half-life t ≈ 125-375 is already this number's first draft); (c) dives to −∞ energy → the least-action two-point BVP fallback (he flags it as much harder; out of this task's scope, recorded) | M5.20.3 observables |
| "negative Hamiltonian terms ... seem necessary to propel neutrino oscillations or electron angular momentum" | He CONFIRMS the measured boost-sector indefiniteness as physical and load-bearing, not a bug: the M5.20.2 census + runaway stand | tracker Q18/Q19/Q23 → ANSWERED |
| "eigenspectrum still seems assumed" (second time) | The measured-not-manual clarification is STILL the top line of the next outbound: M5.20.1's dynamics freely SELECTED the (δ,0)-equalized core (his a ≈ δ/2 value matched); nothing was imposed | next outbound, bullet 1 |
| "energy minimization assumes abundant energy was already radiated ... requires radiation mechanism and time" | Matches the M5.21 measurement (the kick radiates; the statics is a slide): minimization = post-radiation idealization; EL evolution = the honest instrument | context for M5.20.3 + [M5.21.1](m5_21_task_details.md) |
| Check: SO(1,3) not SO(4)? | ✅ ALREADY SO(1,3), machine-verified: M5.18 check 1 transforms M as a rank-2 covariant tensor under random BOOST + rotation (Λ ∈ SO(1,3)), invariance ~1e-11, with the no-eta NEGATIVE control (check 1b, O(1) drift); the rigid-orbit generators are G = ηW (so(1,3)); answer with permalinks | next outbound |
| Check: Tr((Mη)^p) + modified c_p? | ✅ ALREADY in: `v4_density` powers multiply by ηM each step (Tr((ηM)^p) exactly), and C_p = g^p + 1 + δ^p + 0^p comes from the η-spectrum of the branch representative (M_vac = diag(−g,1,δ,0) → ηM = diag(g,1,δ,0)); `Tr_eta(M^p) = tr((eta M)^p)` is the M5.18-verified definition; answer with permalinks | next outbound |
| The thread is PUBLIC now | He cc'd models-of-particles on the method-note link ("Fable can handle their simulations") and convened Marc/Andras/Giorgio on loop = electron vs neutrino, offering to help if convinced; also rallying help re "few days left with Fable" | user's call on posture; the internal framing page [`../m5_particle_hunt.md`](../m5_particle_hunt.md) is exactly this question |
| Comms window | Message 1 landed same-evening (his 20:51); the deeper checks arrived his morning as predicted; next outbound should land before 14:00 EDT | standing |

### Notes

| Item | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Tracker | Q18 + Q19 + Q23 (the fused constraint question) → ✅ ANSWERED 2026-07-13: no constraint added by hand; free EL of the assumed L with its own degenerate-kinetic structure; minimization only as the initial-state builder |
| Next | Fold into [M5.20.3](m5_20_3_task_details.md) (done same-day) → user "go M5.20.3" |

## 2026-07-14: M5.20.3 ran his answer; the outbound draft (results + his two checks + the Q24 ask)

**Context**: the task ran his 2026-07-13 prescription verbatim same-day (record: [`m5_20_3_task_details.md`](m5_20_3_task_details.md), note: [`../findings/m5_20_3_method_note.md`](../findings/m5_20_3_method_note.md)). Verdict: the free-EL IVP is ill-posed; every regularization blows up in finite time with E → −∞ (HIS pre-named fallback branch fires); q never unwinds; the (g, 1, a, a) core lands at statics (a = 0.85 δ/2); the vacuum ladder is ρ-chirped. New ask = [Q24](../m5_question_tracker.md#q24-detail) (BVP confirmation). **Send: user-gated, next 14:00 EDT window (2026-07-15). Backstage posture stands.**

**Draft text**: removed 2026-07-14 evening (unsent; superseded by the entry below; standing rule: proposed outbound texts stay out of this public repo, terminal-only). It covered: his two checks (permalinks) · the M5.20.3 results · the Q24 BVP ask.

**Decode/routing**:

## 2026-07-14 evening: the outbound draft UPDATED at the M5.20.5 close (supersedes the morning draft above)

**Context**: since his 2026-07-13/14 constraint answer, THREE tasks ran: [M5.20.3](m5_20_3_task_details.md) (his prescription verbatim: ill-posed IVP, his branch fires), [M5.20.4](m5_20_4_task_details.md) (the formulation search: alternatives eliminated, balance roots EXIST), [M5.20.5](m5_20_5_task_details.md) (the rigid level measured OUT + the escape dead at statics; audited 7C/2Q). The γ = −1 sub-ask is WITHDRAWN (answered by our own measurement); the ask sharpens to BVP confirmation + the profile-dynamic (breathing) clock question. **M5 PARKS on this message + his answer.** Send: user-gated, 14:00 EDT window (2026-07-15). Backstage posture stands.

**What to send (decision at review)**: ONE email covering everything since his last message, anchored on the M5.20.3 note (the "we ran your answer" document), with the 20.4/20.5 notes as depth links: NOT the 20.5 note alone. **Two image attachments** (also committed in-repo, permalinked inline): `plots/m5_20_3_film_recipe.png` (the pre-singular window: the loop HOLDS its shape while the blowup nucleates at a point, q = 0.500 throughout: his branch, visualized) and `plots/m5_20_5_a1_ladders.png` (the balance-root ladders: the least-action positive that grounds the breathing question).

**Draft text**: NOT stored in this repo (public GitHub; standing rule 2026-07-14: proposed outbound message texts are delivered in the TERMINAL at review only). The draft covers: his two checks (permalinks) · the M5.20.3 verbatim-run results incl. the film · the compressed M5.20.4/20.5 formulation search · the sharpened Q24 ask (BVP confirmation + the profile-dynamic/breathing clock; γ = −1 withdrawn as self-answered).

**Decode/routing**:

| Item | Route |
| --- | --- |
| His two checks | unchanged (M5.18 check 1 + 1b; `v4_density`/`c4_of` permalinks) |
| M5.20.3 (his prescription) | leads the results; the film attachment = the visual of HIS branch firing with q intact |
| M5.20.4 + M5.20.5 | compressed to one paragraph: alternatives dead (lemma + measurement), roots real (ladders attached), rigid level out (directional), escape self-answered |
| γ = −1 sub-ask | WITHDRAWN: reported as a measurement, no question spent (ask-economy per ask-when-gated) |
| Q24 (the one question) | BVP confirmation + the breathing/profile-dynamic clock; his two named alternatives (rigid class we missed / constraint surface) offered back |
| Attachments | `m5_20_3_film_recipe.png` + `m5_20_5_a1_ladders.png` (committed in-repo; blob URLs resolve after Rodrigo's commit) |
| Timing | user-gated; 14:00 EDT window 2026-07-15; backstage posture stands; **M5 PARKED on this message + his answer** |

**SENT 2026-07-14 19:22 EDT** (Rodrigo sent same evening rather than waiting for the 14:00 window; reply landed his next morning: the evening slot works too).

## 2026-07-15: Duda's reply: the Q24 deferral + THE ELECTRON REDIRECT (two messages, group-cc'd)

**Context**: reply to the 2026-07-14 19:22 send, Wed 2026-07-15 04:25 (his ~10:25 morning), cc'd to models-of-particles + **Filip Blaschke** (soliton/BPS specialist, newly on-thread) with "difficult questions somebody might have hints for (e.g. for article coauthorship)"; opens "Thank you Rodrigo and Fable, looks very nice!". A second message same day 15:45 (to Paul, Marc, Chris, the list) added the PRX "Agentic Exploration of Physics Models" article + re-posed the negative-Hamiltonian handling question to the group.

**Decode/routing**:

| Item | Decode | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Q24: DEFERRED, not confirmed** | "Regarding least action approach, I think about it - can elaborate, but generally it seems quite difficult"; second message adds "numerically it doesn't seem practical (?)" | Q24 stays OPEN on his side (he owes the elaboration); no further ask spent; the breathing-BVP stub NOT runnable |
| **THE REDIRECT: electron hedgehog** | "Maybe better, if stuck with neutrino as vortex loop, it is now worth to switch to investigate complementing perspective: of electron as hedgehog - which (in contrast to neutrino) has to be stable." Prescription: biaxial hedgehog ansatz (his Fig. 9, arXiv:2108.07896; already transcribed + conformance-checked at [M5.17 phase D](m5_17_task_details.md)); z-axis vortex regularized with TWO equal eigenvalues; center = all THREE spatial eigenvalues equal; 511 keV mass mainly in the center, vortex extremely light (pairing opposite spins / Cooper pairs); **minimize energy in 3D → static solution → extend to 4D where energy minimization should lead to angular momentum + gravitational mass**; perpendicular low-energy twists → Klein-Gordon-like (Fig. 9) | = the [M5.20.6](m5_20_6_task_details.md) folding table's electron-redirect row: M5.20.6 ARCHIVED as the loop-side reserve; **[M5.21.1](m5_21_1_task_details.md) becomes the live next task** with his prescription folded |
| **Spec correction 1: `(-g)^p`** | "in your `C_p = g^p + 1 + delta^p` should be `(-g)^p`, but we should just be open if sign of g is positive or negative" | Machine-checkable, both signs: our current build IS the `ηM = diag(+g,1,δ,0)` branch (M5.18 `v4_density`/`c4_of`); the correction adds the `(−g)` branch as a co-equal candidate → M5.21.1 phase P0 (both-sign targets + statics regression) |
| **Spec correction 2: physical scales** | "your delta is huge ~0.2, while should be delta~10^-10, and g ~ 10^10 (plus or minus). But numerically such large values are problematic (need practical approximations)" | Consistent with the paper's own anchors (`δ² ~ ħc`, `g⁴ ~ 1e38`, logged at M5.17 phase D). Toy regime stays sanctioned as the practical approximation, but every quantitative claim is regime-qualified until the (g, δ) scaling laws are charted → M5.21.1 scaling phase |
| **His direct request: neutrino aging** | Radiating vortex loop → "neutrino aging" (distance-growing energy threshold), final flash at R→0; "DAMA/LIBRA data with annual oscillations seems fitting such 'final neutrino flash' hypothesis. Could you check if it fits various neutrino data?" | → NEW parked task **[M5.20.7](m5_20_7_task_details.md)** (phenomenology/literature, no GPU); user decision 2026-07-16: runs AFTER the M5.21 series |
| Voids question | "are there experimental suggestions that voids require some active mechanism helping with their formation?" (Boötes; his EM-charged-particle energy-minimization suspicion) | Parked, no task; recorded here; revisit only on user call |
| Blowup-prevention hint | (msg 2) "beside negative Hamiltonian terms, there are also positive activated together with field derivatives - what should prevent going to minus infinity" | A measurable balance claim: the M5.20.3 trajectories can be re-read for the positive-vs-negative term split along the dive → folded as an optional M5.21.1 diagnostic |
| Channel state | Msg 2: PRX "Agentic Exploration of Physics Models" + "Already Fable nearly doesn't need human-in-the-loop... might be the last chance for humans to really participate"; coauthorship floated; Blaschke on-thread; he asks Paul/Andras/Giorgio how the electron interpretation handles the instabilities | He is publicly legitimizing the AI-assisted workflow on the same list as the 2026-07-08 episode; posture unchanged (backstage, voice separation); Paul-relayed content stays evidence-not-resolution |

### Notes

| Item | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Tracker | Q24 → 🔶 DEFERRED-BY-AUTHOR (detail updated); no new Qn opened (his corrections are directives to implement, his two data questions are tasks, not asks) |
| User decision (2026-07-16) | **Electron-first: the M5.21 series is the program now.** M5.20.6 archived (loop-side reserve, not relevant while the loop hunt is parked); M5.20.7 (neutrino aging) created but parked AFTER the M5.21 series; all Duda 2026-07-15 content folded into the M5.21 plans; both film-strip templates (basic + thermal) on every M5.21-series run |
| Next | [M5.21.1](m5_21_1_task_details.md) finalized at PLAN, awaiting user "go" |
