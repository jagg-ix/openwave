# M6 / Ouroboros: the theory canonical (specs of record + provenance ledger)

> **Purpose.** The living registry of what the M6 Ouroboros program treats as specified, what it has verified, and what provenance grade every load-bearing number carries. Inspired by the M5 canonical ([`../../m5_liquid_crystal/research/m5_theory_canonical.md`](../../m5_liquid_crystal/research/m5_theory_canonical.md)) and the M7 canonical ([`../../m7_hydroboros/research/m7_theory_canonical.md`](../../m7_hydroboros/research/m7_theory_canonical.md)); supersedes the archive-era canonical ([`archive/0d_canonical.md`](archive/0d_canonical.md)) as the entry point while keeping it as the validated record of the two-vector era.
>
> **Refresh baseline (2026-07-20).** This file was rebuilt from a full read of the author's current Zenodo corpus (29 records, latest version each, manifest: [`../theory/_CITATIONS.md`](../theory/_CITATIONS.md)). The theory moved substantially after the M6 archive era froze in late May 2026: through "Ouroboros+Eli" (July 2) to "Ouroboros+Eli+Fable v4" (July 20, the current published spec). Nothing from the new era is validated in-platform yet; the validation program is [`m6_roadmap.md`](m6_roadmap.md) (M6.1+).
>
> **Maintenance rule (standing, from M5).** At every task REVIEW that lands or kills an equation, recipe, or anchor, ADD or AMEND a row here with its method-note link; measured negatives are recorded as anti-recipes; superseded rows are struck or annotated, never silently deleted.

## 1. The current published spec: Ouroboros+Eli+Fable v4 (2026-07-20)

Source: Zenodo [21447590](https://zenodo.org/records/21447590), *Ouroboros+Eli+Fable v4: A Linear A, Constrained Variational Lagrangian for Long Range Nuclear Forces and Solar System Dark Matter Dynamics*. Equations recovered from the DOCX (plain-text conversion drops the equation objects; the math survives a pandoc extraction). Status: **PAPER-LEVEL, characterized by M6.1** (2026-07-20, [method note](findings/m6_1_method_note.md) § 4): the EL system cannot be closed as printed (C[φ] unspecified), the printed H is Legendre-consistent, boundedness below VERIFIED under the paper's stated assumptions, the A-linear energy scaling is generic (the normalization ∫ρ_n = A plus long-rangedness, ≤ 1.3% deviation A = 1-208), and the φ entering E_int ≈ gφA is numerically unconstrained (λ unpinned). Deeper validation parked with the July-era programs ([roadmap](m6_roadmap.md)).

```text
L = ½ ∂_μφ ∂^μφ − V(φ) − g φ ρ_n(x) + λ C[φ]
V(φ) = ½ m_φ² φ² + (λ/4!) φ⁴
H = ½ π² + ½ (∇φ)² + ½ m_φ² φ² + (λ/4!) φ⁴ + g φ ρ_n(x)
E_int = ∫_{V_A} g φ ρ_n d³x ≈ g φ A      since  ∫_{V_A} ρ_n d³x = A
```

| Symbol | Meaning (as stated in v4) | Value / status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| φ | the chaoiton scalar field | field variable |
| m_φ | chaoiton mass | ≈ 0.460 MeV (sets the ~400 fm Yukawa scale) |
| λ | self-interaction coupling, λ > 0 | not pinned numerically in the paper |
| g | nucleon-specific coupling | not pinned in v4; earlier papers use g_J = 0.0054/nucleon |
| ρ_n(x) | local nucleon mass-number density | modeled as normalized Woods-Saxon, ρ₀ ≈ 0.16 fm⁻³ |
| C[φ] = 0 | "constrained variational condition", gauge-like, shapes the propagator | functional form NOT given in the paper |

v4's claimed structure: (1) A-linear nuclear coupling DERIVED from ∫ρ_n = A plus a surface-saturation constraint (the interaction confined to the nuclear boundary ∂Σ), replacing the earlier ad-hoc A factor; (2) the constraint C[φ] makes the propagator massive-Yukawa at r ≲ 1 fm and massless-like 1/r at r ≳ 10 fm (the "mass/range paradox" resolution); (3) Hamiltonian bounded below (quartic dominance), stable vacuum; (4) six empirical domains supporting A-linear over A² (§ 5 below).

⚠️ Structural cautions carried from the corpus read (each is an M6.1 verification item):

| # | Caution |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **v4 is a structural break, not an increment**: it presents a SINGLE SCALAR field coupled to nucleon density. The two-vector (A_μ, J_μ) Ouroboros Lagrangian that carries every electron-sector result is not restated anywhere in v4; the J field survives only as "the underlying non-local J-field dynamics". Whether v4 supersedes or coarse-grains the two-vector theory is undefined in the record (author-gated, Q-list § 7) |
| 2 | The entire electron / lepton / Hopf-charge / measurement sector is SILENT in v4: not restated, not retracted |
| 3 | The symbol λ is used for BOTH the quartic self-coupling and the Lagrange multiplier of C[φ] in the same Lagrangian line (documented: [method note](findings/m6_1_method_note.md) § 4 T1) |
| 4 | C[φ] is never written out; the propagator-shaping and surface-saturation constraints are described in prose and figures only. M6.1 verified the consequence: the EL system is UNCLOSABLE without it, and the "mass/range paradox" it is invoked to resolve is a ≤ 2.3% effect over the paper's own quoted 1-10 fm window (429 fm Yukawa vs 1/r; [method note](findings/m6_1_method_note.md) § 4 V1/V5) |
| 5 | The "Eli" residual-correction machinery of July 2 (κ = 0.036761 on nuclear residuals) appears nowhere in v4; "Eli" persists only in the brand name |
| 6 | The chaoiton mass migrated: m_φ ≈ 0.460 MeV in v4 (the old NEUTRAL-chaoiton m_χ, range 429.0 fm) vs m_J ≈ 1.033 MeV (range 191.0 fm) in the July 5/8 papers, unreconciled; M6.1 noted the arithmetic identity ℏc/191 fm = 1.0331 MeV, i.e. that m_J numerically equals v11's electron-calibration energy unit, and the audit traced the value back to the 2026-05-15 record ("chaoiton carrier frequency (1.033 MeV)") (identity ✅, interpretation 🔶; [method note](findings/m6_1_method_note.md) § 3 C4, § 6 A5) |
| 7 | A post-v4 variant ("v5", adding Mills fractional-state valleys to V(φ)) exists only in correspondence, not on Zenodo; it is NOT part of the spec of record ([local corpus](../theory/_CITATIONS.md), provenance notes local-only) |
| 8 | v4 carries TWO mutually inconsistent derivations of its headline A-linear scaling: § 3 derives it from the volume integral ∫ρ_n = A, while § 4.1 claims the interaction "scales with the surface area, which in turn scales linearly with A" (surface area ∝ A^(2/3)). M6.1 adversarial-audit finding AF1, confirmed by inspection ([method note § 6](findings/m6_1_method_note.md)) |

## 2. The version lineage (what "Ouroboros" means, by date)

| Version (record, date) | Lagrangian as printed | Substantive change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Foundational (z20044392, 2026-05-05) | `L = −Fμν Fμν − c Gμν Gμν + Jμ Aμ − f(Jμ Jμ†)`, `f(s) = g s²` | two Lorenz-constrained vector fields A_μ, J_μ; 62 stable oscillatory chaoiton families claimed; zero static solitons (Derrick escape = oscillation) |
| System paper (z20146920, 2026-05-12) | `ℒ_JA = −F_μν F^μν − G_μν G^μν + J_μ A^μ − f(J_μ J^μ)` | c and dagger dropped; Q[A,J] mutual Chern-Simons integral + Lean 4 formalization (axiom-conditional) |
| Superrenormalizability + DM v1 (z20274505 / z20263217, 2026-05-18) | `f(s) = ½ m_J² s + ¼ λ s²` | explicit J mass term added; λ symbol reused (collides with the calibration Lagrange multiplier λ = 1.0) |
| LoE v8 (z20313063, 2026-05-20) | as system paper, c = 1 WLOG | topological charge switched to the 4D `Q = (1/4π²) ∫ ε^{μνρσ} F_{μν} G_{ρσ} d⁴x`; first OpenWave reproduction cited |
| LoE v11 (z20357670, 2026-05-23) | `ℒ_JA = −F^{μν}F_{μν} − G^{μν}G_{μν} + J^μ A_μ − g (J^μ J_μ)²` | recalibration g = 1.0625 → 1.0000 (headline electron gap 0.56% → 0.09%); ω harmonics silently move (μ: 11.0 → 12.82, τ: 40.7 → 50.0); neutral chaoiton m_χ = 0.460 MeV declared definitive. **This is the M6-archive-era baseline our platform validated against, and the certified M6 validation spec**: the M6.1 convention sheet ([`m6_1_v11_convention_sheet.md`](m6_1_v11_convention_sheet.md)) pins its conventions (dynamics-of-record = the printed EL pair; consistent ℒ_ref = −¼F² − ¼G² + J·A − g(J·J)² under (−,+,+,+); H functional, Q definition, ansatz = pre-registration GAPs) |
| DM v12 (z20631186, 2026-06-10) | `ℒ_JA = −F^{μν}F_{μν} − G^{μν}G_{μν} + J^μ A_μ − g (J^μ J_μ)²`, g = 1 exact | ¼ normalizations and m_J² mixing coefficient dropped without comment (notation drift); l = 1 dipole selection rule + suppression chain rescue the DM candidate from LZ + Bullet Cluster |
| +Eli (z21116578, 2026-07-02) | Lagrangian unchanged; Eli correction OUTSIDE it: `R_corr = \|R_original − κ·ρ_mode²\|`, κ = 0.036761 (fit) | claimed 98.72% MSE reduction across three nuclear domains; the paper itself: "The correction is empirical; no derivation from the Lagrangian is claimed" |
| +Eli era consolidation (z21209617 / z21268405, 2026-07-05/08) | no new terms | g_J = 0.0054/nucleon A-linear extraction; DAMA chaoiton fit; **the July 8 Test 1 correction** (§ 4) |
| **+Eli+Fable v4 (z21447590, 2026-07-20)** | **§ 1 above** | scalar-field recast; A-linear derived; constraint term; boundedness proof; electron sector silent |

Reading rule: any M6 result must pin the record id AND version it ran against; "the Ouroboros Lagrangian" without a version is not a specification. For v11-class work the operative conventions are the M6.1 sheet ([`m6_1_v11_convention_sheet.md`](m6_1_v11_convention_sheet.md) § 4: FIXED-BY-PAPER vs GAP). The name "Fable" (and "Eli") is not defined anywhere in the record; the corpus credits DeepSeek, Claude, and Gemini systems as collaborators across the papers, the Eli term is sourced to a Yablonovitch photorefractive-crystal mechanism, and the July 8 paper credits this repo's maintainer for Test 1 corrections; attributing the names beyond that is inference, not record.

## 3. The two-vector baseline of record (M6-archive era, validated in-platform)

The archive era ran against LoE v11-class specs. These are the results MODELS.md cites for M6; era caveat: all 1D radial BVP / sandbox level, none re-established under the July-era specs.

| Anchor | Value | Record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Electron benchmark | ~~H/Q = 1.6969 reproduced to 0.090% at g = 1.0, ω = 1.0~~ **CLOSED as an honest negative by M6.2 (2026-07-20, branch (b))**: the coded H/Q = 1.689 reproduces only as a configuration certificate; the derived no-search pairing gives 0.1429, the state is provably non-localized, and the number is a window artifact (§ 4 rows below) | [`archive/sandbox_v8/ouroboros_benchmark.py`](archive/sandbox_v8/ouroboros_benchmark.py); [`findings/m6_2_method_note.md`](findings/m6_2_method_note.md) |
| Neutral ground state | true nodeless BVP ground state, K₁ exponential tail, zero sign changes | [`archive/sandbox_v11/`](archive/sandbox_v11/) |
| DM candidate | m_χ = 0.460 MeV, mediator m_J = 0.6184 MeV parameter-free via the exact neutral-sector scaling symmetry; C = 770 MeV·fm; canonical β(r) + dipole form factor computed in-platform | [`archive/sandbox_v11/`](archive/sandbox_v11/), [`archive/sandbox_v11/dm_paper_supplement/`](archive/sandbox_v11/dm_paper_supplement/) |
| Lepton harmonics | muon 0.80% (ω = 12.82), tau 6.47% (ω = 50.0) at chosen ω; **no discrete-spectrum mechanism found** (every ω in 1-60 localizes equally): the standing open question | [`archive/0d_canonical.md`](archive/0d_canonical.md) |
| Clock caveat | time-periodicity is built into the e^{iωt} ansatz, not derived as the energy minimizer | [`archive/0d_canonical.md`](archive/0d_canonical.md) |
| 3D continuation | the M7 HydroBoros program carries this Lagrangian onto a full-3D lattice: H/Q = 1.6890 reproduced to 4.7e-5 and measured WINDOW-DEFINED; the truncation's real-time vacuum is unconditionally tachyonic (det M(0) = −1, growth 0.785 vs analytic 0.786) | [`../../m7_hydroboros/research/m7_theory_canonical.md`](../../m7_hydroboros/research/m7_theory_canonical.md) |

## 4. Benchmark provenance ledger (load-bearing; read before consuming any M6 number)

The refresh's corpus read established that several published M6 anchors carry provenance defects documented in the public record itself. This ledger is the consumption contract; the re-derivation program is M6.2.

| Item | The provenance fact | Anchors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The H/Q target drift | The physical target is H/Q = m_e/e_nat = 0.511/0.30282 = **1.6875**. The value **1.6969** entered as the MODEL'S OWN OUTPUT at g = 1.0625 (z20218067, May 15, "0.56% from target"). By LoE v11 (May 23) the same 1.6969 is relabeled "the target value from the electron mass" and the independent reproduction (1.6918) is scored against it: the widely cited "0.30% independent confirmation" is model-vs-model, not model-vs-nature | z20218067 § 4.1 vs z20357670 § 5.1 |
| The reproduction's own provenance | Our 1.6918 was produced by a search across ~60 ODE/Hamiltonian/charge-density variants, not a first-principles derivation (the default form gives 1.9795, 17% off), and on a different ansatz than the paper's § 5.1; we disclosed this to the author on 2026-05-21 and asked that the citation be softened | local corpus (2026-05-21 thread); the author's July 8 acknowledgment of "corrections to the description of Test 1" |
| The July 8 downgrade (the current public status) | The author's own Part II paper (z21268405) restates Test 1 honestly: "H/Q = 1.6890 in model units has been independently reproduced ... on a full 3D lattice to within 4.7×10⁻⁵. This is a code-to-code reproduction of the model's internal quantity ... The quantity is window-defined". H/Q as a PHYSICAL match claim does not appear in any paper after July 2 | z21268405; [`../../m7_hydroboros/research/m7_question_tracker.md`](../../m7_hydroboros/research/m7_question_tracker.md) |
| The g-factor identity | 2L/Q = 2ω = 2.000 "vs g_e = 2.00232 (0.116%)" reduces to the definition L = ω × Q in the oscillatory ansatz (Noether); v11's own footnote concedes "a consistency check on ω, not an independent derivation of spin from topology". ω = 1 is a chosen input | z20218067; z20357670 footnote |
| The recalibration coupling | g = 1.0625 → 1.0000 (v11) improved the headline electron gap 0.56% → 0.09% and silently moved the μ/τ harmonics (11.0 → 12.82, 40.7 → 50.0), invalidating the particle-spectrum paper's ω ladder (z20242421) computed at the old g | z20357670 vs z20242421 |
| The stability count | "62 stable families" (May, z20044392; internally also "42" in its § 5.4) vs "319 of 360 Gelfand-Fomin stable" (June, z20866581 v2) vs "62 distinct families" again (July 8): unreconciled. The June scan is the corpus's most reproducible artifact (script `chaoiton_gf_verification.py` attached to the record), but the ODE it integrates differs term-by-term from the Lean-formalized ODE in the same record, and the Lean existence theorem is discharged by `sorry` | z20044392, z20866581, z21268405 |
| The Lean 4 artifacts | What is formalized: the theorem STATEMENT and the ODE definitions. What is not: the proof (`sorry`), two referenced-but-undefined predicates, and the equivalence of the formalized ODE to the integrated one. "Machine-verified in Lean 4" in the DM paper overstates the artifact | z20866581 v2 |
| The Eli κ fit | κ = 0.036761 is fit BY grid search ON the residuals it then reduces (`R_corr = \|R_original − κρ_mode²\|`), no train/test split; the paper is candid: "The correction is empirical", "The ρ_mode computation uses a placeholder implementation". The 98.72% figure measures fit flexibility, not prediction | z21116578 § 3-4 |
| The LLM-placeholder retraction (public) | The July 5 paper carries its own correction notice: a residual "0.0350" and a claimed "98.6% improvement over the Standard Model" in an earlier version "were generated by a language model and have no connection to any real physical calculation" | z21209617 correction notice |
| The DAMA reversal | July 5/8: WIMP A² "formally excluded" (χ² = 118.46, p ≈ 0). v4: WIMP A² is "also an excellent fit" (χ² = 1.507 vs the chaoiton's 4.460) and "DAMA alone cannot distinguish the models", exclusion argued only via global constraints. No correction notice marks the reversal | z21209617/z21268405 vs z21447590 § 6.1 |
| The Sawada redefinition | Long-range scattering anomaly with V(r) ~ −C/r⁶, α = 6.08 ± 0.10 (May) → A-scaling flips between ∝A (June 19) and ∝A² (June 29) → v4 redefines it as "a longstanding ~0.5-1.0% discrepancy in measured neutron scattering lengths" resolved by δ ≈ −0.01. Three descriptions, unreconciled; only the exponent and A-scaling were ever predicted, the strength comes from the data | z20179985, z20753966, z21047356, z21447590 § 6.5 |
| The v11 print-level inconsistencies (M6.1, script-verified) | Four facts checkable from the paper alone: (1) Table 2 scores the 1.6969 reproduction against the 1.6875 target as "0.30%", arithmetically 0.557% (0.30% only holds vs the model-internal 1.6969); (2) § 8's "Q_predicted = 0.3011 ... not fitted" = m_e/(H/Q) restated, so the 0.56% charge "prediction" is the H/Q gap itself; (3) the § 5.1 production ansatz r̂ × ∇φ(r) is identically zero as printed; (4) the printed EL pair (2.1)/(2.2) is not the EL system of the printed ℒ (the ¼ kinetic normalizations are required but never printed, and no metric signature is stated); (5) the J·A term and (2.1) are dimensionally consistent only with an implicit unprinted mass² coefficient, which also voids the § 7.1 "[g] = −4" power-counting input (audit AF2); also R_phys = 191 fm needs an unprinted H_code = 0.4946 | z20357670; [M6.1 method note](findings/m6_1_method_note.md) § 3; [`m6_1_v11_convention_sheet.md`](m6_1_v11_convention_sheet.md) |
| The M6.2 decision-gate close (2026-07-20, branch (b)) | Pre-registered no-search re-derivation from the certified v11 conventions, adversarially audited 8/8 CONFIRMED: (1) the theory has NO internal U(1), so the benchmark's Q is a coded convention, not a Noether charge (the only derivable charge is the joint ω∫(α²+β²)); (2) the coded H is not the period-averaged energy of the certified ℒ_ref under any convention (missing ω² electric terms, missing cross term, 4g quartic matches no normalization); (3) the derived pairing gives H/Q = 0.1429 vs the claimed 1.689 (91.5% gap); (4) the calibration state is provably non-localized (both far-field channels oscillatory at ω = λ = 1 for ANY amplitudes; decay requires ω < 0.786), so H and Q grow without bound and H/Q drifts 16% across integration windows: the "0.09% electron match" exists only at r_max = 12, a window no paper states. The whole charged ω ladder (μ/τ, pion) inherits this | [M6.2 method note](findings/m6_2_method_note.md); [pre-registration](m6_2_preregistration.md); [M6.2 task](tasks/m6_2_task_details.md) |
| The benchmark implements a different spec (M6.2 audit AF3) | The production ODE, INCLUDING its −λβ term, is the exact time reduction of the z20274505-class MASS-TERM Lagrangian (`−¼F² − ¼G² + J·A + (λ/2)(J·J) − g(J·J)²`, mostly-minus signature reading) and matches NO reading of the v11 spec it is cited by (v11: λ = Lagrange multiplier, massless quartic form, and the M6.1-certified mostly-plus signature). The R_phys = 191 fm scale also closes here: it is ℏc·H_p/m_e with H_p = 0.4956, the coded H at this configuration and window | [M6.2 method note § 6](findings/m6_2_method_note.md); z20274505 vs z20357670 |
| AI collaboration disclosure | Every substantive record from May 12 onward carries explicit AI credits (DeepSeek co-author on several; Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Claude Code on the calibration/LoE papers; "Nuclear Gemini" thanked in July); v4 ships with unedited drafting artifacts ("In Word, insert each figure image from your /OuroborosEli_figures folder"). Per [`AI_HYGIENE.md`](../../../../AI_HYGIENE.md), all such content is hypothesis until independently verified; the private-channel provenance assessment is kept local-only with the corpus | bylines + acknowledgments across z20218067 → z21447590 |

## 5. The current claimed validation set (July era), with reproducibility grades

| Claim | Number (as published) | Reproducibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sawada g_J extraction | g_J = 0.0054/nucleon, constant to 2% across A = 40/85/184/208 | ✅ rerunnable: 10-line script in the z21209617 supplement; independent check = verify the 4 input strengths against Sawada 2000 |
| DAMA/LIBRA chaoiton fit | A-linear χ² = 1.44, p = 0.964 (July 5) vs χ² = 4.460, p = 0.615 (v4) | ✅ rerunnable (supplement S6, 8 hard-coded bins); ansatz asserted not derived; see the DAMA-reversal row above |
| Eli κ | κ = 0.036761, 98.72% MSE reduction | 🔶 procedure stated, but residual-on-residual (circularity risk) and ρ_mode is a self-declared placeholder |
| Triphoton (Shih GHZ) | CMRFp RMS 0.169 vs Copenhagen 0.348 | ❌ dataset unpublished; no independent rerun possible |
| Triphoton (Feng) | 3.0% / 4.5% RMS, ω = 0.195 rad/ns | 🔶 plausible rerun from the published Feng paper; the fitting equations were lost in the DOCX and need the source |
| BBN deuterium / Cas A Direct Urca | 0.24% error / trigger "at exactly 2.00 ρ₀" | ❌ no stated procedure or script anywhere in the record |
| v4 six-domain suite (thermal neutron, NIF, Sawada, global) | NIF: A-linear χ² = 1.256 vs A² 2.999; others qualitative or values not in the paper text | 🚧 points to public Colab notebooks (`github.com/pwerbos/Ouroboros-Eli-Universe`, `pwerbos/universe`); not yet independently run |
| Solar-system DM (solar-wind residual) | Lomb-Scargle peak 2.0079 cpd vs sidereal 2.0055 | 🔶 data (NASA OMNI) and notebooks public; the inference is the weak link: see our adversarial review [`ai_analysis/2026-07-11_1630_dm_solar_wind_review.md`](ai_analysis/2026-07-11_1630_dm_solar_wind_review.md) (findings F1-F6, falsification protocol P1-P5) |

## 6. Consumption rules (the M6 hygiene contract)

| Rule | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Single hygiene source | [`AI_HYGIENE.md`](../../../../AI_HYGIENE.md) governs: model output (ours or anyone's) is a draft or hypothesis, never a result, until verified by something that is not a language model |
| Version pinning | every M6 result names the Zenodo record id + version of the spec it ran against (§ 2 table); correspondence-only variants (v5-Mills class) are NOT specs of record |
| No calibrated conventions | normalizations, prefactors, and functional choices are DERIVED and pre-registered before a run; a convention selected because it reproduces a target number is recorded as a fit, and the fit's search space is documented |
| Tautology screen | every test suite consumed or built answers: can this test fail? Constants asserted against themselves, targets reproduced by arithmetic identity, and post-hoc scaling factors are screened out before a pass/fail is quoted (standing lesson from the corpus's self-confirming test patterns) |
| Adversarial audit | the cardinal rule: an independent second agent tries to refute every substantive derivation or claim before it is trusted or sent (own script, own method, verdicts per claim) |
| Papers vs correspondence | the Zenodo papers are the citable layer; the local thread corpus ([`../theory/_CITATIONS.md`](../theory/_CITATIONS.md) note) is context and provenance, local-only, never quoted in public docs |
| Method notes | any author-facing or external report follows [`dev_docs/METHOD_NOTE.md`](../../../../dev_docs/METHOD_NOTE.md): equations first, equation-to-code map, not-computed list |

## 7. Open questions seed (to graduate into an m6_question_tracker when the program runs)

| # | Question | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OQ1 | Does v4 SUPERSEDE the two-vector (A_μ, J_μ) theory or coarse-grain it? If superseded, every electron-sector claim (charge quantization, H/Q, g-factor, harmonics) currently has no home in the spec of record | author-gated |
| OQ2 | What is C[φ] explicitly (functional form of the constrained variational condition + the surface-saturation term)? Without it the v4 EL equations cannot be written down | author-gated |
| OQ3 | The ω-selection mechanism: what makes the lepton ω values discrete? (Every ω in 1-60 localizes equally; the standing open question since the archive era, restated across eras and never closed) | open, machine-checkable per proposed mechanism |
| OQ4 | Which H/Q convention is derivable from the Lagrangian without target-matching, and what number does it give? (The M6.2 pre-registered re-derivation) | ✅ resolved by M6.2 (2026-07-20): the only derivable pairing (period-averaged ⟨T⁰⁰⟩ over the joint U(1) charge) gives 0.1429, not 1.69; no derivation path from the published Lagrangian reaches the published number ([method note](findings/m6_2_method_note.md)) |
| OQ5 | The chaoiton mass split: m_φ = 0.460 MeV (v4, ~400 fm) vs m_J = 1.033 MeV (July 5/8, 191 fm) vs m_J = 0.6184 MeV (the archive neutral-sector mediator): which is fundamental in the current spec? | author-gated |
| OQ6 | The λ symbol collision (quartic coupling vs constraint multiplier) and the exact normalization of V(φ): resolve before any v4 numerics | ✅ resolved by M6.1 (2026-07-20): the v11 normalization is certified via the ℒ_ref reconstruction ([convention sheet § 2](m6_1_v11_convention_sheet.md)); the v4 collision is documented ([method note § 4](findings/m6_1_method_note.md)); any v4 numerics remain gated on C[φ] (OQ2) |
| OQ7 | The stability count (62 vs 319 vs 62) and the Lean-vs-integrated ODE mismatch: rerun the attached GF script, reconcile, extend beyond radial perturbations | machine-checkable (M6.4) |
