## TASK PLANNING (2026-07-21, go 12:54 EDT)

### Scope

Independent numerical verification of the headline analytic result of the MIT bedrock
first-eigenvalue paper: the first positive eigenvalue of the twisted Laplacian on the
constant-curvature (spherical) Möbius band M(W) with a cone point, and its stability
across the cone's self-adjoint extensions. This is the M8 column's certification gate:
either outcome is a result and informs everything downstream (Λ = 3/R² rides this
eigenvalue).

### The independence protocol (per ONBOARDING_MODELS.md § 6)

| Role | Sees | Does not see |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Designer (this session's orchestrator) | the author's full paper (fetched to the session scratchpad, OUTSIDE the repo) | n/a |
| Solver agent | ONLY a self-contained operator spec sheet (geometry, gluing, boundary conditions, the two realizations defined via cone-trace data) + task list | the claimed eigenvalues, thresholds, eigenfunctions, asymptotics, the author's name/repo/paper, ALL repository docs (explicitly instructed not to read any markdown) |
| Audit agent | the same spec sheet + the solver's outputs + the solver's script | same blindness to the claims |
| Comparison to the claims | done by the designer AFTER both agents return numbers | |

Withheld from both agents: every formula of the paper's Theorems 1.1/1.2 (the values
2/R², α₀(α₀+1)/R², the δ₀ > 2R/e threshold, the λ_b(δ₀) asymptotic, the mode-crossing
location, the eigenfunction forms, the Legendre/lune reductions).

### Pre-registered claims under test (fixed BEFORE numerics)

Units: R = 1 throughout (report λ·R² = λ). "Converged" = Richardson-extrapolated
across ≥ 3 resolutions with a stated error estimate.

| ID | Claim (from the paper, exact) | Pass condition | Fail condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 (PRIMARY, the gate) | λ₁⁺(W) = 2/R² for every 0 < W ≤ πR/2, Friedrichs realization | converged λ₁⁺ within 0.5% of 2 at every narrow-grid W | systematic converged deviation > 0.5% at any narrow W |
| C2 | λ₁⁺(W) = α₀(α₀+1)/R², α₀ = πR/(2W), for πR/2 < W < πR; branches cross (degenerate) at W = πR/2 | converged λ₁⁺ within 0.5% of the formula on the wide grid; near-degeneracy at W = πR/2 | deviation > 0.5% or no crossing |
| C3 | the first positive level is IDENTICAL between Friedrichs and the bridging realization for every δ₀ > 2R/e | measured λ₁⁺(δ₀) matches the Friedrichs value within tolerance for all sampled δ₀ > 0.736R; the empirical stability boundary consistent with 2R/e ≈ 0.7358R | λ₁⁺ moves with δ₀ in the claimed-stable region |
| C4 (secondary) | Friedrichs bottom = 0 (a zero mode exists); bridging carries exactly ONE negative eigenvalue with λ_b(δ₀) → −4e^(−2γ)/δ₀² as δ₀ → 0 | zero mode found at 0 (\|λ\| < tol); one negative eigenvalue whose small-δ₀ trend matches the asymptotic within its O(δ₀²/R²) correction | bottom > 0, no negative state, or wrong count/trend |
| C5 (spec-fidelity) | the numerics implement the paper's own operator (metric, gluing, Neumann arcs, trace-defined extensions), confirmed by the audit | audit CONFIRMS spec fidelity of both implementations | audit finds either implementation deviates from the spec |

No-search rule: every computed number is reported; nothing is tuned toward the
claims; if the numbers land somewhere else, that IS the result (the M6 lesson).

### Definition of done

| # | Item |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Solver agent returns converged spectra for the W-grid (Friedrichs) + the δ₀ scan (bridging) + an internal cross-check discretization, scripts + JSON in the repo |
| 2 | Adversarial audit agent independently recomputes with its OWN method, audits the solver's script, per-claim verdicts |
| 3 | Designer comparison against C1-C5, verdicts stated with all numbers |
| 4 | Method note `findings/m8_1_method_note.md` (equations first, eq-to-code map, embedded plots, audit record) |
| 5 | Doc sync staged for REVIEW: canonical § 3 status flip, MODELS.md gravity-cell note, roadmap row, briefing status row |
| 6 | Doc checker exit 0 over touched files; TASK REVIEW presented in terminal |

### Blindspot pass (what could go wrong, checked in advance)

| Blindspot | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| The naive discretization silently selects ONE extension (typically Friedrichs), making the extension scan vacuous | the spec DEFINES both realizations via the cone-trace data (u_N, u_D); the bridging family must be implemented as an explicit matching condition; audit checks which realization each solver actually lands on |
| Transverse-sector truncation misses the true λ₁⁺ (the wide band moves the lowest level to a different sector) | the spec requires the low spectrum, not one sector; audit checks sector completeness |
| Weighted-measure errors near the cone (\|f\| → 0) fake convergence | ≥ 3 resolutions + extrapolation required; audit uses a different discretization family |
| A zero mode masquerades as "first positive" (or vice versa) at finite resolution | the spec asks for the lowest 6 eigenvalues INCLUDING any ≤ 0, so the positive level is identified from the full low spectrum |
| The seam (gluing) condition is mis-signed, shifting the anti-periodic sector | audit re-derives the seam handling independently; C1's W-independence on the narrow grid is itself a sensitive detector |
| Independence leak (agent finds the claims in the repo) | agents instructed to read NO markdown; the author's paper lives only in the session scratchpad, not the repo |

### Sub-experiments

| ID | What | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | Solver: Friedrichs W-grid + δ₀ scan + internal cross-check | `scripts/m8_1_eigensolve.py` (+ xcheck), `data/m8_1_*.json` |
| S2 | Adversarial audit: own method + script audit | `scripts/m8_1_audit_eigensolve.py`, `data/m8_1_audit_*.json` |
| S3 | Designer comparison + plots | `plots/m8_1_*.png`, this doc § FINDINGS |
| S4 | Method note + sync | `findings/m8_1_method_note.md` |

## DEVIATIONS LOG

(none: the pre-registered protocol ran unmodified; the only correction of the run,
AF-1, was an audit finding about the solver's summary wording, dispositioned in the
method note § 5)

## FINDINGS

Full record with plots and the audit: [`../findings/m8_1_method_note.md`](../findings/m8_1_method_note.md).

| ID | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| F1 | THE GATE PASSES. C1 + C2 ✅: the first positive eigenvalue is 2/R² across the narrow band and α₀(α₀+1)/R² beyond, confirmed by two mutually independent blind implementations (weighted FEM + Frobenius series vs Chebyshev collocation + Riccati shooting) agreeing to ≤ 1.4e-8, inside stated error bars, including two W points the solver never ran |
| F2 | C3 ✅ in the strongest possible form: the extension-stability threshold was BISECTED BLIND to δ₀* = 0.7357588823, equal to the author's claimed 2R/e = 0.7357588823 to 1e-12. Neither agent ever saw the constant |
| F3 | C4 ✅: Friedrichs bottom is exactly 0 (the discontinuous ± zero mode, residual 1e-13); the bridging family carries exactly one negative defect state at every δ₀, and the blind-extrapolated coefficient C0 = −1.2609470067 equals the claimed −4e^(−2γ) to 10 digits |
| F4 | C5 ✅: all six spec-fidelity audit checks passed; one defect found and dispositioned (AF-1: the solver's summary stated the stability onset at its grid point 1.3895 instead of the true transition; its number tables were correct throughout) |
| F5 | Independent structural corroboration: the auditor, blind, re-derived the exact sector ladder λ = (m_n + j)(m_n + j + 1), the same Legendre structure the author's proof uses, with seam parity dropping out of the eigenvalues, exactly as the paper's §-structure implies |
| F6 | Consequence for the column: the MIT arena's headline operator statement (Theorems 1.1 + 1.2 of the first-eigenvalue paper) is now VERIFIED IN-PLATFORM at 10-digit precision. This clears the author's own "awaiting independent verification" block and satisfies the M8.2 gating condition. The Λ = 3/R² inference (Gauss-Codazzi step, the R-problem) remains a separate, untested chain link |

## TASK REVIEW (2026-07-21)

`Task Duration: 01:07 (from 12:54 to 14:01 EDT)`
`Usage Cap Triggered: NO`

| Item | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| C1 narrow-band 2/R² | ✅ CONFIRMED exact (two blind implementations, 1.3e-10 agreement; audit closed-form covers all W ≤ πR/2; new blind W = 0.45) |
| C2 wide branch + crossing | ✅ CONFIRMED to every digit (new blind W = 2.0 → 1.4022484374 vs 1.4022484385) |
| C3 stability threshold | ✅ CONFIRMED strongest form: δ₀* bisected blind = 0.7357588823 = 2R/e (1e-12) |
| C4 bottom structure | ✅ CONFIRMED: zero mode exact; one bound state; C0 = −1.2609470067 = −4e^(−2γ) (10 digits, blind) |
| C5 spec fidelity | ✅ audit 6/6; AF-1 (solver summary threshold wording = grid granularity) dispositioned in the method note § 5 |

Issues: AF-1 only (reporting wording, not numerics). Deviations: none.

**Findings**: The MIT arena's headline operator statement (Theorems 1.1 + 1.2 of the
first-eigenvalue paper) survived a fully blind, two-agent, adversarially audited
verification at 10-digit precision, with the theory's structural constants (2/R²,
2R/e, −4e^(−2γ)) re-derived by agents that never saw them. The M8 certification gate
PASSES, clearing the author's verification block, satisfying the M8.2 gating
condition, and flipping the column's first MODELS.md cell (gravity 🚧 → ⚠️).
