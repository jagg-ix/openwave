# M7.8: the helicity-pair 3:1 test + the Phase 1 walkthrough

> **Status: ✅ DONE** (2026-07-07, review approved; GO confirmed at the 2026-07-06 Phase-1-review call with the author; Phase 1 extension). Roadmap row: [`m7_roadmap.md`](../m7_roadmap.md) § DONE. Author-convo record: `theory/author_convos/m7_phase1_convo.pdf` (local-only). Results: [`§ FINDINGS`](#findings-2026-07-07-execution); the walkthrough package for the author: [`m7_phase1_walkthrough.md`](m7_phase1_walkthrough.md) (§ 7.1 = this task's results; ships after M7.9 + M7.10 complete it).

## 1. Context and what changed at the call

| Input | State |
| --- | --- |
| The Q15 units contract | **RESOLVED-directive** ([tracker](../m7_question_tracker.md#q15-detail)): the author pins no frequency mapping ("the frequency is emergent... there is only one frequency that works"); the directive is "make the decision that gives us the proper spin ℏ/2, whatever's coming out of your model is fine". The **observable `S_z = ℏ/2` is the target**; this task measures it |
| The 3:1 ratio | The author suspects early-model drift in his own notes but ruled: "it's part of the model right now, so we run with it, that's part of the ansatz". The two-line algebra (§ 3) is not in dispute; whether the closure postulates survive full 3D nonlinear relaxation is the measurable question |
| The audit loop | Agreed at the call: we run at zero cost to him, send the data + the walkthrough, and **he runs his own adversarial pass** (his tools, his framing). We treat whatever comes back as external-audit evidence per [`AI_HYGIENE.md`](../../../../../AI_HYGIENE.md) |
| Trust context | The author's stated blocker is under-the-hood visibility ("how could a single-person team on a laptop run extensive complex simulations..."): deliverable (b) answers it head-on |

## 2. Deliverables (three)

| # | Deliverable | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a | The helicity-pair run (§ 4) | `U₊/U₋` measured vs the closure prediction `3 + α/2 + 4f_bb`; the pair-asymmetry spin `(U₊ − U₋)/ω` measured vs the ℏ/2 directive |
| b | [`m7_phase1_walkthrough.md`](m7_phase1_walkthrough.md), the under-the-hood report (§ 5) | readable by the author standalone; every § 5 question from the call answered with evidence links |
| c | Refresh [`m7_theory_canonical.md`](../m7_theory_canonical.md) (scheduled refresh #1; #2 rides M7.21) | METHOD_NOTE-current (file:line audit links, not just section permalinks); self-sufficient on: the ansatz, the integrator, the lattice, how charge is computed, how energy is computed; both Q15 frequency readings versioned in § 4 until the measurement decides |

## 3. The prediction being tested (from the 2026-07-05 closure notes, re-derived at receipt)

With `U₊ + U₋ = ℏω` (one quantum, P2) and `(U₊ − U₋)/ω = ℏ/2` (spin, P3):

```text
U₊ = 3ℏω/4,  U₋ = ℏω/4   ⟹   U₊/U₋ = 3                       (δ = 0)
U₊/U₋ = (3 − 2δ)/(1 − 2δ) ≈ 3 + α/2 + 4f_bb ≈ 3.004 + 4f_bb   (δ = α/8 + f_bb)
```

The arithmetic is forced; the physics under test is whether P2 + P3 survive in the full nonlinear 3D theory. Cross-formalism design: the notes predict analytically in a thin-torus ansatz; the lattice relaxes to the true minimizer with no ansatz assumed in the final state, then reads the observables.

## 4. Run plan (deliverable a)

### 4a. Seed recipe (the repaired pair, concrete lattice construction)

Angle conventions follow the closure notes: **φ = poloidal, θ = toroidal** (note this is the REVERSE of the usual plasma convention; the notes' `m` counts poloidal winding). Lattice angles: `θ_tor = atan2(y, x)`; `φ_pol = atan2(z, ρ − R₀)` with `ρ = √(x²+y²)`; minor radius `d` from the existing `_ring_frame` (`m7_4_linked_vortex.py:261`).

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Closure parameters in lattice units | `ω = cλ₀` (P1) with the canonical `ω = 1` gives `λ₀ = 1`, `σ = 2/λ₀ = 2`, `w = λ₀σ² = 4` (the Case-B pinning expressed in program units) |
| Radial profile | LG ground state `Ψ(d) = (d/σ)e^{−d²/2σ²}` (exact under the closures; replaces the Bessel `F` of the constant-λ modes) |
| Mode components (from the notes' CK formulas, `F → Ψ`) | `A_r = −[(m/d)Ψ + (k/(sλ₀))Ψ′]sin χ` · `A_φ = −[Ψ′ + (mk/(sλ₀ d))Ψ]cos χ` · `A_θ = (sα²/λ₀)Ψ cos χ`, with `k = n/R₀`, `α² = λ₀² − n²/R₀²`; **`A_r ≠ 0` kept (repair #1)** |
| The pair | mode `(+)`: `(m, n, s) = (1, +1, +1)`, phase `χ₊ = φ + θ − ωt`, amplitude `a₊`; mode `(−)`: `(1, −1, −1)`, `χ₋ = φ − θ − ωt`, amplitude `a₋`; **the curl-eigenvalue sign `s` flips WITH the winding (repair #2)**, which is what makes the two helicities genuinely opposite (`A·B = sλ₀\|A\|²`) |
| Harmonic doublet split | `cos(χ₀ − ωt) = cos χ₀ cos ωt + sin χ₀ sin ωt` → seed `a_c` from the `cos χ₀` parts, `a_s` from the `sin χ₀` parts (a rotating pair, `a_s ≠ 0`, per the M7.5 design rule) |
| J priming | `j = −0.1·a` per the `build_seed` convention (`κ = −1` basin, `m7_4_linked_vortex.py:278`) |
| Geometry | `R₀ = 4 (= L/4)` primary; note `σ/R₀ = 0.5`, exactly the "moderate, keep symbolic" regime the notes flag, so run ONE `R₀ = 6, L = 24` check; the finite-R width splitting `σ± ≈ σ(1 + 1/(2R₀²))` is below grid resolution at these R₀ (state it, do not chase it) |

### 4b. Design decision: the asymmetry is a LADDER, not one run (registered caveat)

Two facts from Phase 1 make a single √3-seeded run insufficient:

| Fact | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| For near-Beltrami sectors `U± ≈ ±λ H±`, so the net helicity `H_A = H₊ + H₋` largely PINS `U₊ − U₋` (`U₊ − U₋ ≈ λ_eff H_A`), and our relaxation FIXES `H_A` | the spin observable is partially imposed by the constraint, not discovered by relaxation; an honest design treats **`H_A` as the dial**: run an amplitude-ratio ladder, let each rung relax, and ask WHERE the target sits and whether the closure's √3 rung is energetically special |
| At `a₊/a₋ = 1` exactly, the seed has `H_A ≈ 0`, and both Phase 1 frames kill zero-helicity states (evaporation at fixed `H_A`, M7.4; band-edge delocalization at fixed `Q_can`, M7.6); worse, the current rescale restore DISARMS when H crosses zero (the `H·H0 > 0` guard in `relax_qcan`, the M7.6 blend_standing hole) | the "unbiased control" cannot be ratio 1.0; the control question ("does relaxation FIND the asymmetry?") is answered by whether off-√3 rungs drift toward √3 under a **through-zero-safe restore** (small tooling fix, budgeted in § 4d) or show an energy minimum at √3 |

**The ladder:** `a₊/a₋ ∈ {1.2, 1.5, √3 ≈ 1.732, 2.0, 2.5}` at fixed total `Q_can` (the pair's own, from seed normalization). Per rung: relax, measure `U₊/U₋`, the asymmetry `(U₊ − U₋)/(U₊ + U₋)`, and `E`. The deliverables are the two curves `U₊/U₋` vs seeded ratio and `E` vs asymmetry.

### 4c. Measurement definitions (pinned before the run, so the numbers are unambiguous)

| Quantity | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `U±` (per-helicity energy) | helical (Waleffe) decomposition in k-space: FFT the complex doublet `F = f_c + i f_s`, project onto the `e±(k)` helical basis (eigenvectors of `i k̂ ×`), sum the quadratic energy per sector; computed for the A sector (where the helicity guard lives), J-sector reported alongside |
| Cross-check on `U±` | (i) sector identity: `U₊ − U₋` vs `λ_eff H_A` (near-Beltrami consistency); (ii) overlap of the relaxed state with the two seeded CK modes (construction-specific reading); agreement across the three readings is itself a finding |
| The spin target, in-model | the Q15 directive `S_z = ℏ/2` with the P2 quantum `U = ℏω` becomes the **dimensionless asymmetry `(U₊ − U₋)/(U₊ + U₋) = 1/2`** (equivalently `U₊/U₋ = 3`); no unit contract needed to test it. The δ-corrected closure shifts it to `1/(2(1−δ))`, i.e. `U₊/U₋ = 3 + α/2 + 4f_bb` |
| Resolution honesty | the α/2 correction is 0.37% of the ratio; Phase 1 grid convergence is 0.15% (N 64→96): the PURE 3:1 test is well within resolution, the α-correction is at the edge: report the measured deviation with the grid-ladder error bar, do not claim the α digit unless the ladder supports it |
| Continuity battery | energy budget closure, `\|g\|`, r50, `λ_eff` alignment map, `j_z` per quantum (`jz_per_quantum`, `m7_functional.py:164`), per the M7.6 pattern |

### 4d. Execution ladder

| Step | Content |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | tooling: through-zero-safe helicity restore in `relax_qcan` (additive correction or penalty fallback when `\|H\|` is small); budgeted first, it gates the low-ratio rungs |
| 1 | seed builder + seed-level gates: measured seed `H_A` vs the analytic `s`-weighted expectation; `∇·A` pattern vs the notes' divergence identity `∇·A = −A_r λ′/λ` (qualitative: charge on the gradient shell, zero at core) |
| 2 | 48³ smoke: one rung (√3), 500 iterations, constraints hold, no blow-up |
| 3 | 64³ record: the five-rung ladder, 1500+ iterations each (~4 min/rung at the M7.5 regen rate) |
| 4 | measure per § 4c, assemble the two curves, grid-check the winner rung at 96³ |
| Outcomes | closure lands → the postulates survive 3D and the spin-½ cell gains an in-model measurement; closure fails → the failure mode localizes it (which postulate, or the thin-torus truncation); the ladder design makes EITHER outcome quantitative: even a null is "the asymmetry the functional actually selects is X" |
| Artifacts | `scripts/m7_8_helicity_pair.py` · `data/m7_8_*.json` · `plots/m7_8_*.png`, checkpoints to `research/checkpoints/m7_8_progress.md` |

## 5. Walkthrough plan (deliverable b): [`m7_phase1_walkthrough.md`](m7_phase1_walkthrough.md)

Skeleton already in place; filled during this task. Tuned to the author's register (flow and orbits, evolution-first language, the Lagrangian relegated to a derivation note). Section plan and the call question each section answers:

| § | Content | Call question it answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The discovery narrative: the five-step chain to the stable rotating electron (pre-filled) | "show me how it was found" |
| 2 | What is actually integrated: the evolution equations at each step, energies as field quadratures, line-by-line code map | "what's the PDE, what's the actual equation you're integrating" |
| 3 | Numerics: the integrator (velocity-Verlet / leapfrog), the drift-fix history, `O(dt²)` convergence evidence, conservation traces, why it does not explode at Zitter-like scales | his own symplectic/Taylor crash experience |
| 4 | The automated test suite: inventory + current pass report (auto-generated from the gate JSONs) | "let's make sure we have tests automated that show the PDE is behaving correctly... generate me a report" |
| 5 | "Approximately Beltrami", precisely: `λ_eff = F·(∇×F)/\|F\|²` defined, the 0.96 alignment map shown | "is that word salad?" |
| 6 | The system under the hood: human + AI + repo governance (AI_HYGIENE, method notes, script-backed claims, adversarial audits), and the honest answer to "one person + a laptop": GPU lattice + AD gradients + agent throughput + validated gates + known-answer tests at every step | the David-and-Goliath question |
| 7 | The extension results, one report: § 7.1 = the M7.8 results (from deliverable a); § 7.2 = the [M7.9](m7_9_chaosbook.md) benchmark scorecard; § 7.3 = the [M7.10](m7_10_pure_maxwell.md) pure-Maxwell results (2026-07-07: the walkthrough ships to the author once all three land) | the agreed data handoff |
| 8 | Reproduce everything: `m7_7_canonical.py` quick mode, the grid ladder, and the local-install path for when he takes it | "I do want to install OpenWave at some point" |

## FINDINGS (2026-07-07, execution)

Artifacts: [`../scripts/m7_8_helicity_pair.py`](../scripts/m7_8_helicity_pair.py) (modes `seed` / `smoke` / `run` / `grid` / `audit` / `analyze`) · data [`m7_8_seed_gates.json`](../data/m7_8_seed_gates.json) · [`m7_8_smoke.json`](../data/m7_8_smoke.json) · [`m7_8_ladder.json`](../data/m7_8_ladder.json) · [`m7_8_audit.json`](../data/m7_8_audit.json) · [`m7_8_grid96.json`](../data/m7_8_grid96.json) · plot [`m7_8_ladder.png`](../plots/m7_8_ladder.png).

![m7_8_ladder](../plots/m7_8_ladder.png)

### 1. Machinery gates (all green before any physics claim)

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Helical-split completeness (Parseval, transverse ± + longitudinal + curl-null buckets vs the real-space quad energy) | **1.5e-16** ✅ |
| Projector calibration (single `s = ±1` CK/LG mode lands in its sector) | 93.5% ✅ (the 6.5% = toroidal-curvature mixing at `σ/R = 0.5`, a seed property, not a projector error) |
| Sign consistency (mode `s = +1` → `H_A > 0` → `U₊`) | ✅ after the frame fix (execution log: the naive poloidal angle gives a LEFT-handed triad; caught by this gate) |
| Beltrami identity on the seed `(U₊ − U₋)/(ωH_A)` | 1.057 ✅ (≈ 1) |
| Divergence identity (charge on the gradient shell, zero at core) | ✅ qualitative (rms core 9.7e-3 < shell 1.25e-2) |
| Constraints through every relaxation | `Q_can` exact, `H_A` to 5 digits, `\|g\|` 6e-8 - 1.5e-6 ✅ |

### 2. THE HEADLINE: the pair is not stationary; relaxation expels the minus mode at every rung ✅ measured

The five-rung ladder (N = 64, fixed `Q_can = 13.2017` + the rung's own `H_A`, 1500 FIRE iterations each):

| ratio a₊/a₋ | `H_A` | E | `U₊/U₋` relaxed | asym `(U₊−U₋)/(U₊+U₋)` | `E/\|H_A\|` | r50 | align | `j_z` (A) | `U_long` % |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.2 | 1.70 | 3.0903 | 104 | 0.981 | 1.82 | 5.33 | +0.707 | 0.499 | 45.7 |
| 1.5 | 3.62 | 3.7386 | 184 | 0.989 | 1.03 | 4.78 | +0.755 | 0.940 | 3.7 |
| √3 | 4.70 | 4.2110 | 528 | 0.996 | 0.895 | 4.37 | +0.861 | 0.975 | 2.2 |
| 2.0 | 5.64 | 4.7327 | 644 | 0.997 | 0.838 | 4.06 | +0.913 | 0.992 | 1.1 |
| 2.5 | 6.81 | 5.5066 | 1077 | 0.998 | 0.808 | 3.70 | +0.946 | 0.990 | 0.4 |

Three measured statements:

| Statement | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| The thin-torus helicity pair with `U₊/U₋ = 3` is **nowhere stationary** in the fixed-`(Q_can, H_A)` frame: every seeded asymmetry runs to the single-helicity boundary | asym 0.981 → 0.998 monotone; `U₊/U₋` is 2-3 orders of magnitude above the closure value at every rung (plot, left panel, log scale) |
| The basin it falls into is the **known electron family**: as `H_A` rises the relaxed states converge to the Arnold-efficient Taylor family | `E/\|H_A\|` → 0.808 at the top rung (the M7.4 family law 0.8016; the M7.6 electron = 0.802); align → 0.946; r50 → 3.70; `j_z` → 0.99 per quantum |
| The in-model pair-asymmetry spin reads **≈ 1 quantum (ℏ under P2), not ℏ/2** | asym ≈ 1 at every rung; consistent with the M7.6 single-mode `j_z = 1` per quantum |

### 3. The low-`H_A` anomaly, flagged honestly

The 1.2 rung's `j_z = 0.499` is a **mixture artifact, NOT a spin-half state**: 45.7% of its A-sector energy sits in the longitudinal (curl-free) bucket. At low helicity the excess `Q_can` norm condenses into the cheap curl-free reservoir (`E/Q_can = 0.23`, near the M7.6 band-edge condensate value 0.19); the `j_z` average is diluted by that reservoir. The new `U_long` observable (added when the Parseval gate caught the 2.7% deficit) is what makes this diagnosis one line instead of a mystery.

### 4. Adversarial audit: CONFIRMED ✅

Refutation attempt (the AI_HYGIENE cardinal rule): re-insert minus-mode content into the relaxed √3 state at amplitude ε, restore BOTH constraints exactly, measure `E(ε)`. If E fell anywhere, the expulsion would be a relaxation artifact.

| ε | 0.02 | 0.05 | 0.10 | 0.20 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dE` | +4.2e-3 | +2.7e-2 | +1.1e-1 | +5.3e-1 |

`dE` rises **quadratically in ε** (positive curvature): the pure-plus state is a genuine directional minimum against minus-mode re-insertion. Verdict recorded in [`m7_8_audit.json`](../data/m7_8_audit.json).

### 5. Grid check (96³) ✅

The √3 rung re-run at N = 96 (`h = 0.167`): E = 4.1872 vs 4.2110 at 64³ (**0.57% grid shift**), asymmetry **0.996 identical**, `U₊/U₋ = 505` (vs 528), `E/\|H_A\| = 0.893`, `j_z = 0.978`, `\|g\| = 1.1e-7`. The expulsion and the basin are grid-converged; only the energy carries the expected sub-percent grid dependence. Data: [`m7_8_grid96.json`](../data/m7_8_grid96.json).

### 6. What this means for the closure postulates and Q15 (stated carefully)

| Item | Reading |
| --- | --- |
| P3 as pair asymmetry (`S_z = ℏ/2` from `U₊ − U₋` of a two-mode state) | the **mechanism does not survive 3D relaxation in this frame**: the functional prefers all transverse energy in one helicity sector; the 3:1 arithmetic (which we re-derived and stands) never gets a stationary state to live on |
| The `S_z = ℏ/2` directive | NOT met by pair asymmetry here; the stable states read one quantum. The surviving route to ℏ/2 is the **frequency mapping** (the Zitter/`ω_D = 2ω_C` reading, canonical spec § 4: per-quantum `j_z = 1` reads ℏ/2-per-2ω-cycle), i.e. exactly the Case-A-flavored reading, while the closure notes pinned Case B via P3. Both readings stay versioned; the measurement now weights them |
| Honest boundary of the claim | measured in THIS frame (fixed net `Q_can` + net `H_A`, pure-vector sector, the frame validated by M7.3-M7.6). NOT excluded: a frame fixing the two helicities **separately** (`H₊`, `H₋` as independent constraints), the scalar/charge sector active, or the pair as a resonant (metastable) rather than minimal state. These are the natural author questions the data now poses |
| Either-outcome clause from the plan | fired on the "closure fails" branch, quantitatively: the failure mode is localized (the P3 pair mechanism, not the arithmetic and not the thin-torus profile per se) |

## EXECUTION LOG (2026-07-07)

| Time | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 15:18 | go (reset 7:20pm; resume ping armed at 7:25pm, slot `Resume: Task M7.8`) |
| 15:22 | seed gates v1: projector purity 93.5% but **two catches**: (a) the naive poloidal angle `atan2(z, ρ−R₀)` makes the toroidal triad LEFT-handed (the `s = +1` mode measured `H_A < 0`, curl eigenvalues flipped vs the notes); (b) the helical split dropped the longitudinal component: Parseval deficit 2.7%, which is exactly the charge-carrying `∇·A` content |
| 15:25 | both fixed: right-handed frame (`φ = atan2(−z, ρ−R₀)`), longitudinal bucket `U_long` added (physically meaningful: the k-space face of the divergence charge). Seed gates v2 ALL GREEN: projector 93.5% with consistent signs, **Parseval 1.5e-16**, Beltrami identity `(U₊−U₋)/(ωH_A) = 1.057`, divergence on the gradient shell (rms core 9.7e-3 < shell 1.25e-2). The 6.5% seed impurity = toroidal-curvature mixing at `σ/R = 0.5`, a seed property, reported |
| 15:27 | smoke (48³, √3 rung, 500 it): converged clean (`\|g\| = 1.6e-6`, constraints exact). **THE SMOKE FINDING: the relaxation EXPELS the minus mode** (relaxed `U₊/U₋ = 521`, asym 0.996, `j_z = 0.972`): at fixed `(Q_can, H_A)` the two-mode pair is not stationary; the functional falls into the single-helicity rotating basin (= the M7.6 electron). Arnold economics: minus-sector energy carries canceling helicity, pure-plus is the efficient state |
| 15:30 | 64³ five-rung ladder launched (background); walkthrough §§ 2-6 + 8 filled; canonical refresh #1 applied (§§ 1b, 1c, map rows, charge prose, § 3b placeholder) |

Deviations from plan: none yet (the projector calibration and the sign fixes are exactly what the § 4d step 1 gates were for).

## TASK REVIEW (2026-07-07)

**Task Duration:** 01:47 (from 15:18 to 17:05 EDT)
**Usage Cap Triggered:** NO (resume ping parked without firing)

**Results** (full detail: [`§ FINDINGS`](#findings-2026-07-07-execution)):

| Gate | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| machinery gates | ✅ helical-split Parseval **1.5e-16** (longitudinal bucket added when the deficit gate caught it), projector 93.5% sign-consistent, seed Beltrami identity 1.057; two bugs caught BY the gates pre-physics (left-handed toroidal frame; missing longitudinal sector) |
| the closure prediction `U₊/U₋ = 3 + α/2 + 4f_bb` | ✅ measured, NOT observed: the pair is **not stationary at any seeded asymmetry**; the minus mode is expelled at all 5 rungs (relaxed `U₊/U₋` 104 → 1077, asym 0.981 → 0.998) |
| the pair-asymmetry spin vs ℏ/2 (Q15 directive) | ✅ reads **≈ 1 quantum (ℏ under P2), not ℏ/2** at every stable state of this frame; the ℏ/2 route shifts to the frequency mapping (Zitter/2ω) |
| the basin | ✅ the Phase 1 electron family (`E/\|H_A\|` → 0.808 vs 0.802, `j_z` → 0.99) |
| adversarial audit | ✅ CONFIRMED: minus re-insertion at fixed constraints raises E **quadratically** |
| grid check | ✅ 96³: asym 0.996 identical, E shift 0.57% |
| deliverable b (walkthrough) | ✅ §§ 2-6, 7.1, 8 filled; §§ 7.2/7.3 await M7.9/M7.10 |
| deliverable c (canonical refresh #1) | ✅ §§ 1b, 1c, map rows, charge prose, § 3b, § 4 weighted |

**Issues / blockers:** the low-`H_A` rung's `j_z = 0.499` is a longitudinal-reservoir mixture artifact, NOT spin-half (flagged, § FINDINGS 3). No >1MB raw data created (all artifacts small JSONs + one plot; nothing to delete). Doc checker exit 0 across all touched files.

**Deviations from plan:** none.

**Action needed:** the sharpest author question the data poses (does a separately-constrained-helicity / charge-sector-active / resonant ensemble rescue the P3 pair mechanism?) rides the M7.8 package for the author's external pass; the walkthrough ships after M7.9 + M7.10 complete § 7; next = "go M7.9".

**Findings**: The thin-torus helicity pair behind the 3:1 closure is nowhere stationary in the full nonlinear 3D functional: relaxation expels the minus mode at every seeded asymmetry (adversarially audited, grid-checked) and lands in the known single-helicity electron family, so the pair-asymmetry spin observable reads one quantum rather than the targeted ℏ/2, shifting the surviving ℏ/2 route to the frequency mapping (the Zitter/2ω reading). The closure's arithmetic stands; what 3D relaxation rejects is the two-mode stationarity postulate, and the measurement is bounded honestly to the fixed-`(Q_can, H_A)` pure-vector frame, with the separately-constrained-helicity ensemble as the open question the data poses back to the author.
