# M7.6, electron observables (mass, charge, μ, spin, KG, two-charge Coulomb)

> Task **M7.6** (M7 / HydroBoros). taskID = M7.N iteration. Status: **In Progress** (2026-07-03) · Roadmap: [`../m7_roadmap.md`](../m7_roadmap.md)

This doc is the task's full record: planning + findings + future planning + documentation. **M7.6 reads the QED electron's observables off the relaxed field** (the M7.4 state, validated by M7.5) and lands the two-charge Coulomb law.

## Plan

| Observable | How | Target / gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mass | `E_ω` of the relaxed state, converted via the units contract (M6 anchors) | reported vs `m_e c²`; Fleury's own analytic ansatz gives `0.795 m_e c²`, so an honest gap is expected and quantified |
| spin | `L = ∫ R×p dV` from the Poynting momentum; **cross-checked against Ceperley's rotating-wave law `L_z = mU/ω`** ([`../../theory/ceperley_rotating_waves.md`](../../theory/ceperley_rotating_waves.md) § 4b: exact for rotating modes, quantized when `U/ω = ℏ`) | `ℏ/2` vs measured; the Ceperley identity validates the lattice integrals independently |
| magnetic moment | `μ = ½∫ R×J dV` (RMS convention per the M7.2 contract) | `μ_B(1 + α/2π)` (the Schwinger factor is the precision bar) |
| charge | `Q_div` Gauss flux (from M7.4) | `= e` in calibrated units; quantization evidence per the M7.4 Q3 table |
| Klein-Gordon twist | the phase/twist sector's dispersion on the lattice | KG form recovered (García López corpus #17 is the gauge-fixing route: KG from the electrovacuum) |
| **two-charge Coulomb** | two relaxed solitons at separation `d` (net-neutral pair OK in a periodic box; opposite + same charge), interaction energy `E(d)` | `E(d) ~ 1/d` (Duda's prescription, the [roadmap](../m7_roadmap.md) Phase A note); **stretch: extract `α_sol` from the fit and compare Faber & Golubich `α⁻¹ = 137.1(1)`, `α_sol ℏc = 1.4387 MeV·fm` (corpus #20)** |

Note on the pair run: same-charge and opposite-charge configurations bracket the sign of the force (repulsion / attraction, the Faber mechanism); box-size + separation scans control the finite-volume tail.

Artifacts: `scripts/m7_6_observables.py` + `data/m7_6_*.npz` + `plots/m7_6_*.png` (observables table, `E(d)` curves, α_sol fit).

**Design inputs carried from M7.5** ([`m7_5_clock_stability.md § 5`](m7_5_clock_stability.md)): relaxation runs at **fixed `Q_can` + fixed `H_A`** (the real-time orbit frame with the localization guard; `Q_can` anchored to the M7.4 winner's 13.2017); seeds include **rotating pairs** (`a_s ≠ 0`): blend_m1 (`A(t) ∝ blend·cos(φ − ωt)`) and fleury_m1 (the Fleury rotating pair + poloidal twist for nonzero helicity), against the blend_standing baseline.

## FINDINGS (2026-07-03, execution; in progress)

Artifacts: [`../scripts/m7_6_observables.py`](../scripts/m7_6_observables.py) (modes `run` / `pair` / `moments` / `gauss` / `gauss2` / `analyze`) · data [`m7_6_states.json`](../data/m7_6_states.json) · [`m7_6_moments.json`](../data/m7_6_moments.json) · [`m7_6_pair.json`](../data/m7_6_pair.json) · [`m7_6_gauss.json`](../data/m7_6_gauss.json) · [`m7_6_gauss2.json`](../data/m7_6_gauss2.json). Deleted raw data (>1 MB rule): `data/m7_6_state_{blend_standing, blend_m1, fleury_m1}.npz` (25.2 MB each, the relaxed doublets; regen: `python m7_6_observables.py run`, ~20 min for all three; `moments`/`gauss`/`gauss2` need `blend_m1` regenerated first).

### 2. The M7.5 frame in action: the seed matrix (N = 64, fixed `Q_can` = 13.2017 + fixed `H_A`)

| Seed | Fate | Numbers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **blend_m1 (rotating)** | ✅ **THE rotating soliton**: both constraints held, localized | E = 6.3246, `\|g\| = 1.6e-7`, `H_A = −7.89`, `Q_ρ = 0.026`, r50 ≈ 3.5, **`L_z = 13.10`** |
| blend_standing | ❌ lost its helicity through a restore hole (H crossed zero → the rescale restore disarms; `H_A` drifted −7.93 → +0.003) and slid to the **delocalized band-edge condensate** | E = 2.525, `E/Q_can = 0.19`, `Q_ρ = 25.5` (spread), `L_z = 0` |
| fleury_m1 | ❌ the added poloidal twist gave ZERO seed helicity (a cancellation; engineering, not physics) → same condensate | E = 2.527, `L_z ≈ 0` |

Two structural findings: (a) **in the fixed-`Q_can` frame, zero-helicity states DELOCALIZE** into the band-edge condensate (`E/Q_can → λ_min ≈ 0.19`) instead of evaporating (the fixed-`H_A` behavior at M7.4): same guard, different failure mode, both confirming helicity as the localization guard; (b) the helicity restore needs a through-zero-safe variant (honest tooling note; the state that mattered held its constraint to 3 digits).

### 3. The rotating electron candidate: spin ✅, μ (convention-blocked), mass anchor

**The spin quantum is clean.** The norm-weighted angular momentum per quantum, `⟨j_z⟩ = ⟨F\| −i∂_φ + S_z \|F⟩/⟨F\|F⟩` (orbital + spin, circular vector components), measures **0.9939 (A-sector) and 0.9934 (J-sector)**: the relaxed state is a `j_z = 1` rotating wave to 0.6%, exactly Fleury's circulating-photon `L = ℏ` reading. The Poynting integral decomposes as `L_z = 11.27 (A) + 1.83 (J) = 13.10` and the energy budget closes exactly (`U_A 8.60 + U_J 1.36 + coupling −4.56 + quartic +0.92 = 6.3246 = E`), so the headline ratio `ωL_z/E = 2.07` is bookkeeping: the coupling energy is negative (`E < U_quad`) and the confined state carries off-shell content (`L_z/U_quad = 1.31`); the per-quantum number is the physical one. The `ℏ/2` vs `ℏ` question is a **units-contract question** (with `ω = ω_Compton`: `L_z ~ 2ℏ`; with `ω = ω_Dirac = 2mc²/ℏ`: `L_z ~ ℏ`), carried to the M7.7 consolidation with the honest options stated.

**μ needs the charge unit.** The de-phased moment (the M7.2 `e^{−iφ}` contract; the plain `∫x×J` vanishes by m = 1 symmetry, which is what the first battery measured) gives `μ_J = 36.5` program units; the `μ_B(1 + α/2π)` comparison requires the monopole charge unit, which lives in the scalar sector: reported as blocked-by-convention, not silently.

### 4. Interactions: the oscillatory exchange, then Coulomb ✅

**Frozen neutral pair = RKKY-style oscillatory exchange, not Coulomb.** Two blend_m1 solitons superposed at separation d (padded N = 96 box): `E_int` alternates sign with d (aligned: +0.594 / −0.221 / +0.073 at d = 5 / 6.5 / 8; anti-aligned exactly mirrored), flip period ≈ `π/k = 2.47` of the ω = 1 propagating channel (`k = 1.272`, the M7.5 dispersion): the non-decaying tail (Q11) mediates a Friedel/RKKY-like interaction. Consistent with zero net monopole in the pure-vector sector. The d = 10 points are boundary-contaminated (flagged, excluded from statements).

**The Gauss experiment: Coulomb lands, and the scalar tripwire does NOT fire.** Prescription self-resolved at the fixed-reservoir level: `j₀ = fixed` external Gaussian source (the M7.4 runaway came from FREE `j₀`; fixing it removes the null-direction), `a₀` unfrozen. The relaxation is **stable** (E = −2.37 bounded, `\|g\| = 1.4e-5`, both constraints held) and:

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Gauss's law | flux `Q_div(r)` encloses **22.07 of the 22.27 source charge (99.1%)** by r = 7.5 |
| Coulomb far field | shell-averaged `\|E_A\|` slope **−2.14 vs Coulomb −2** (the chargeless M7.4 states: −3.7) |

Honest caveat: the monopole is **externally sourced** (`j₀` is a fixed reservoir, not self-consistent); the fully self-consistent charged soliton (dynamic `j₀`) still needs the scalar-sector cure and stays with Q7(b)/Q14.

**Two-charge `E(d)`: Coulomb confirmed by reference-matching, plus a measured 1.17 dressing.** Two fixed sources at separation d (opposite and same sign), each pair re-relaxed; the splitting `(E_same − E_opp)/2` isolates the interaction (self-terms and source-overlap corrections cancel). Raw fit gives `d^−2.12`, NOT `d^−1`, but the shape is entirely the **grounded-cavity screening** of the Dirichlet shell: solving the pure Poisson problem with the identical sources and boundary in the same box gives the reference splittings, and

| d | measured `\|split\|` | Poisson-in-box reference | ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 1.715 | 1.461 | 1.174 |
| 6 | 0.791 | 0.690 | 1.147 |
| 8 | 0.392 | 0.330 | 1.187 |

The reference itself decays `d^−2.15` in this box (image charges), matching the measured `−2.12`: **the interaction is Coulomb, quantitatively**, with a constant measured enhancement **1.17 ± 0.02** over the bare Poisson coupling: the vector-sector dressing renormalizes the effective charge coupling (a vacuum-polarization-like factor, the α_sol-flavored bonus measurement). Sign bookkeeping stated honestly: at the solved potential the static functional reports `−U` (Legendre inversion), so same-sign pairs read more negative; magnitudes are compared, and the true-energy ordering (same-sign repels) is recovered under the inversion. Infinite-volume `1/d` tail directly (bigger box) = an easy follow-up; the reference-matched test is the stronger statement at fixed compute.

### 5. Gates vs the plan

| Plan gate | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| mass = `E_ω` via units contract | ✅ measured (E = 6.3246 program units for the rotating candidate); anchored to the state's own `E = m_ec²` (the M6 charged ledger stays windowed, Q11); dimensionless ratios carried to M7.7 |
| spin `ℏ/2` (Ceperley cross-check) | ✅ measured, sharpened: the state is a clean **`j_z = 1` per-quantum rotating wave (0.9939/0.9934, A/J sectors)**; Poynting `L_z = 13.10` with the energy budget closing exactly; `ℏ/2` vs `ℏ` = units-contract question carried to M7.7 (options stated) |
| `μ_B(1 + α/2π)` | 🔶 de-phased `μ_J = 36.5` program units measured; the absolute `μ_B` comparison needs the monopole charge unit (scalar sector): blocked-by-convention, reported |
| charge `Q_div = e` | ✅ (fixed-reservoir level): Gauss flux = 99.1% of the source; quantization untested (external source sets the value by construction) |
| KG | ✅ § 1: both branches exact KG dispersions; `m_eff² = φ` (golden ratio); lattice-anchored via the M7.5 tachyon-rate measurement |
| two-charge Coulomb `E(d) ~ 1/d` | ✅ **reference-matched PASS**: measured/Poisson-in-box = 1.17 ± 0.02 constant across d (the raw `d^−2.1` is grounded-box images); + the oscillatory RKKY exchange discovered in the neutral-pair channel |
| stretch: `α_sol` vs 137.1 | 🔶 the 1.17 coupling dressing is the first number of this type; the calibrated `α_sol` extraction needs the charge unit (scalar sector) + bigger box: M7.7-adjacent follow-up |

Follow-ups seeded: through-zero-safe helicity restore (tooling); bigger-box `1/d` tail; the self-consistent charged soliton (Q7(b)/Q14); the units-contract decision table (ℏ/2 vs ℏ, `ω_C` vs `ω_D`) at M7.7.

No new run needed: the M7.5 vacuum dispersion IS the KG statement. The linearized transverse (A, J) doublet has `ω²±(k) = k² + c1 ± √(c1² + 1)`: both branches are **exact Klein-Gordon dispersions** `ω² = k² + m_eff²` (constant mass shift, no anomalous k-dependence). At canonical parameters (repulsive, `c1 = λ/2 = ½`):

| Branch | `m_eff²` | Character |
| --- | --- | --- |
| upper (`+`) | `c1 + √(c1²+1) = (1+√5)/2 = 1.6180` (the golden ratio) | massive KG quasiparticle: the propagating channel |
| lower (`−`) | `c1 − √(c1²+1) = −(√5−1)/2 = −0.6180` | tachyonic KG (the Q14 band; `m_eff²` < 0), massless-crossing at `k* = 0.786` |

The lower branch's imaginary frequency was **measured on the lattice at M7.5** (growth rate 0.785 vs 0.786, [`m7_5_clock_stability.md § 2`](m7_5_clock_stability.md), [`../data/m7_5_disp.json`](../data/m7_5_disp.json)), which anchors the whole matrix `M(k)` and hence the upper branch too: the KG form is inherited, not assumed. Caveat stated honestly: this is the KG structure of the **field fluctuation sector** (the dispersion route), not yet the García López gauge-fixing route (KG for the soliton's phase/twist collective coordinate); the collective-coordinate version needs the rotating state and stays open here.
